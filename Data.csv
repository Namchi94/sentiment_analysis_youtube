0,"Ashley is so right about medical galighting in US. I also think post covid stuff may have been happening earlier. Am RN who got lower resp infection in very early 2016 took mos to clear but got every symptom of MG and quit being able to only sleep. Have had wild covid in 2020 in March and all symptoms so bad was 8 mos of hourly struggles but because of hypoxia already had O2 and bipap at home. Have had 2 abn muscle biopsies, 3 abn  EMG and  had diagnosis pingpong played around me. In disgust I asked to try Mestinon even without antibodies. Had positive response in 2 days but not more than 30% improvement over a yr. Some days are nearly impossible to live through. Just glad to know am not alone, even as alone."
1,"The unvaccinated are mostly younger people who will very rarely die of COVID if they catch it.  The vaccinated are mostly older people (almost 100% are vaccinated from age 50 up).  That&#39;s why the vaccinated outnumber the unvaccinated three to one in our hospitals, which is about the same ratio they have in the general population.  Statistics are odd things."
2,"I m  not vaccinated , am 42 , Before covid i had heart problems , survive sepsa , broken apendex , spinal deformation , neurological problems because spinal cord , i smoke from my 14 years , I was 6 years in my room without a 1 second on the sun. I got covid 1 month ago and just 1 day i feal litlbit not good , no hi temps , basicly nothing."
3,I just got better from my first covid sickness or whatever and I have a lot of the symptoms they talk about..
4,"Absolutely true!! I was infected in April 2021 and was in bed for 2+ weeks. Almost 5 months later I was suffering with fatigue and depression. It&#39;s about end February 2022, I can go for decent walks but not fully fit like before. Have fatigue and body aches on and off !! I am about 40 and have been fit and fine before covid without any conditions!!"
5,Why did people forget the lessons of Post-SARS in 2002?
6,"Could you cover this recent study? “Intracellular Reverse Transcription of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 In Vitro in Human Liver Cell Line”. It shows concerns from the shots, such as genomic toxicity, cancers and/or autoimmune disease."
7,I was sick with a dry cough that drove me crazy for 3 months.. weak and unable to move.. ambulances to hospital 3 times and I tested negative for covid every time they tested me. It was horrrrrrrible.. then after them 3 months I felt healthier than I have been since I can remember then I went back to work and got bitten by a venomous snake… now I’m crippled …
8,I am twice vaccinated I don&#39;t feel well I regret to be vaccinated
9,"Oh, it’s all about selling another drug!"

26,Russia wanted to create something more of zhuangbility aka cooler than COVID. Russia was provoked by taunts.
27,"The Ukraine &amp; Russia crisis In simple terms for those that have no idea what is going on. <br><br>-Ukraine used to be in an abusive relationship with Russia, feeding him, letting him use her car &amp; giving him whatever he asked for until she built up the confidence to call it quits back in 1991<br><br>-Since then Ukraine has been working on herself, becoming a strong independent woman with help from friends like France, America, Poland etc. offering her support, loaning her money, &amp; helping her find her way.<br><br>-Ukraine has been enjoying being single for 30 years &amp; looking forward to continuing to grow &amp; create new friendships.<br><br>-Now Russia being the toxic Ex that it is wants her back, and doesn’t want her meeting new people or creating any new relationships. <br><br>-A couple of weeks ago Russia started sitting in the front of Ukraine’s house &amp; when her friends ask him what was he doing there, he said “Oh nothing, just getting a little bit of exercise in, that’s all.” <br><br>-After her friends told her that Russia was potentially getting ready to do something bad to her, he said “They’re lying, they just want you to be scared of me &amp; that’s not what it is”<br><br>-Today Russia broke into Ukraine’s house, beating her up &amp; “taking advantage” of her while on Livestream &amp; double dog daring any of her friends to do something about it &amp; if they do want the smoke, Russia got that thang on"

39,"Those societies and governments that somehow try to resist or negate this inevitable process only marginalize themselves and the communities they govern.

60,"I’m from Taiwan and it’s a seriously biased documentary to only focus on “pilots” life being affected and ignore the main steam public opinion about containing the virus. Several outbreaks were caused by pilots that did not follow the rules and tons of Taiwanese were dead because of that. So the strict virus control policy is widely supported by the locals. I would say the pilots and their families were the super minorities and their situation should be represent the majority of Taiwanese people. Let alone it was the time when Taiwan couldn’t get enough vaccines due to the interfering of China and most Taiwanese people weren’t vaccinated. It would lead to sudden surge of infection cases and huge loads of hospitalizations and death if the government simply released the restrictions to “ comfort the pilots and flying crews”. Btw the Taiwanese government did try once , relaxing the measures to serve the pilots needs, and that ultimately led to the first outbreak of the infection in Taiwan. <br>I knew that DW has a crew and some reporters here in Taiwan and I honestly hope that you don’t  sacrifice your sense of the public opinion here just to play with the “ left-leaning” sense of DW ."

74,"Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Him. There is no other intermediary. May Jesus Bless you, trust Him, give your life - and He will take care of it :pray Convert yourself and believe in the Gospel - Romans 10 8-10 But what does it say? “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,” that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim: 9 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.  : Why this division, in the evil world we are in, we will be treated as objects and put to fight against each other. This is not what human life should be about. What is the point of wars, the constant enrichment of small units that they erode on the people they use in their plan. It is clear where this is going, we are only a pawn in the game and evil wants to use us for its purposes. There isn&#39;t much time left. No matter where you come from, who you are: Christ Is Waiting for you now. Wake up while there&#39;s still a chance. May God Keep u in His care. <br>An interesting thing about a disease that was created in laboratories by man. You don&#39;t remember any other flu: avian, swine, hiv virus that was also created by the human hand. The whole system of pharmacy [I recommend checking the meaning of the word pharmakeia] is not about treatment, but about stuffing the wallets of regular customers, leading them to death.  <br><br>it&#39;s all business, people do not mean night: just look at what is happening in the world. Evil has no friends, does not know what love or loyalty is - it fights against its own. How to overcome evil? A simple way: apply love to him and wait for reactions. Evil doesn&#39;t know what it is, the easiest way to deal with the problem.  [MT 24] And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. 5For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. 6And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. 7For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. 8All these are the beginning of sorrows. 9Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake. 10And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. 11And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. 12And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. 13But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. 14And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. [...] <br>Christ is more powerful than the evil that now rules in this world. &quot;<br><br>Remember that I have won the world &lt;3&quot; Jesus Is Coming - rejoice, the Lord Is near. <br>Just a moment longer and the Bridegroom will come and take His Bride"

Thankfully, the scientists have worked hard to get the vaccines ready in record time which has substantially lowered the death rate. In any case, a pandemic would last for 2-3 years before becoming endemic, either with an extremely high death rate (as in the case of the Flu in 1918-1920) or with a much lesser death rate (as in the case of this one in 2019-2022)."

180,"***What I am about to say is simply my opinion and not stating fact.<br><br>     Let me start with 20 years ago. My then wife suffering from SLE, an immune disorder, and I had twins. <br>Any time one of the twins had a sniffle, runny nose, cough, etc... she would just stuff them full of baby medicines.<br>I get the maternal instinct to comfort your children, but in my opinion it was too much.<br><br>     Perhaps her mother did the same, but my parents never coddled my sisters and I when we had a sniffle our cough.<br>my parents would just &quot; Keep an eye on us &quot; and monitor. If things worsened, they took action. I would catch colds or<br>flu and my parents would make me stay in bed and watch tv. my mom would come in from time to time to check<br>my temperature and give me chicken soup. To this day, I am rarely sick. The last time I had the flu was 1996, and I never <br>get the flu shot.<br><br>     Anyway, back to my then wife...she would simply over do it with the medicines on our children and I kept telling her<br>to let them fight through it but monitor the symptoms and fever. She thought I was cruel and uncaring. She acted like<br>I wanted our children to suffer. I told her that I do care and I certainly do not want them to suffer, however, our newborn children&#39;s<br>immune systems are still in the developing stage and if you have all these medicines to do the work of<br>their immune systems....their immune system will not develop, and they will always seem to be sick.<br><br>     This is pretty much what is going on with this Covid thing. If we are wearing masks everywhere, social distancing, <br>sanitizing our hands etc....aren&#39;t we pretty much doing the same thing ? weakening our immune systems ?<br>I am 57, almost 58 ( September this year ) and I do not wear a mask except where it is required. I have not had a sniffle<br>nor a fever the entire pandemic. The last time I was sick was 1996 with the flu. Statistically I should have got sick, but<br>I have not....and I believe it is because my parents allowed my immune system to develop. <br><br>.....Use it or lose it....."

305,"I spend plenty of time with my kid. We read, I teach her things about engineering and joke around. If your worried about child health then spend time with them."
306,So even though toddler aged children have a very low risk of being infected day care centers are still requiring regular testing. What a waste of testing. Testing when it makes minimal to no changes in what is done is wasteful.

So that the hallway aren&#39;t full every new lesson, but it&#39;s only the teacher who are in the halls at that time, to walk to their next class(room). Same for breaks, let them have breaks in their (class) room (I know it&#39;s less social than a dinning hall or whatever, but different times call for different measures!)<br>I thought of this the first month of Covid, how has something of this nature not  been implemented jet, it seems such an easy fix for that 🧐😇"

For ps: lost year my kid was out of school (one year). The result:  0 times any kind infection. 0 time! We were staying healthy! What about learning in school? NO! NO! If you care about your child, teach him by yourself. You have internet! There are so many websites, program, books, library, channels foe kids. School is prison for your child. Do you remember your school? How much did you learn? Elon Musk had home education. Rich Dad Poor Dad had learn how to earn money NOT in school!"

340,In Scotland from Omicron we have seen a very steep increase in cases but it peaked high and fell away very quickly. Deaths didn&#39;t increase in fact they have continued to fall from the peak of the last Delta wave that started in September. Hospital numbers did increase but soon will fall.

351,What is troubling to me is that back in the 1960s 50s 70s and 80s we had vaccines that eradicated diseases like polio rubella scarlet fever small pox chicken pox in a whole slew of others
352,I am so glad I found this channel
353,CDC is mentioning Omicron will not be the last variant so the next targeting booster on Omicron will only be effective for a short term until the next variants come into contact with us. Science will always be one step behind those variants.

356,"Majority of NI health staff off sick with Covid jabbed and boosted, chief says - Belfast Telegraph, 24/12/2022"
357,"I got Covid 3 weeks after the booster jab. It was mild but lasted almost 2 weeks. You still don&#39;t want to have it, trust me. I can hardly imagine how bad would it be if I had not vaccinated. Get your jabs, wear a mask, stay healthy."

362,"Just got my first Covid infection, started feeling a scratchy throat Thursday evening. Woke up yesterday with a fever, around 101F and sensitive eyes. Got a rapid test and positive for omicron. Slept a lot, fever sustained throughout the day. Today no more fever, throat still a bit scratchy feeling and lower back hurts a bit. Have coughed 0 times and no stuffiness though, surprisingly. Thought I’d get at least a couple more days of having a fever or something but nope.. not vaccinated either."
363,"Omicron is known to be way less harmful, also within countrys with low vaccination rates - so I think it is not likely, and not scientifically  to declare this fact to the injections"
364,"More than 100% you say... Interesting, can someone please explain how you vaccinate more than 100% of you population?"
365,"If they managed to slow down the Delta Variant with the vaccines and Booster shots, that remains a constant with the Omicron variant, but since many people are getting infected with the Omicron strain, it stands to reason that the vaccines are not working against Omicron !!!"

371,"Twenty minutes in and I&#39;m losing my focus looking at those sweet, adorable alpaca&#39;s faces."
372,How could they have a vaccination rate of over 100%?
373,Someone needs to reinforce how to wear masks properly. Good they are wearing them but they are not very effective if worn loosely where air can seep in around the edges. At least pinch the nose wire and make the ear loops shorter if the mask is slipping off your nose.
374,The alpacas are very cute animals

382,It is mandatory to wear a mask in 🇲🇾 Malaysia.
383,"What I don&#39;t understand is that why some people think omicron wave could be good thing and last big wave. As many people get infected, as the new variant coronavirus will emerge, which means the next variant could be highly contagious and severe."
384,How do you have a vaccination rate of over 100%?!
385,Fully vaccinated and I&#39;m still scared.🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
386,"since Omicron is not much dangerous, lets hope it quickly spreads and everyone gets immunity."
387,Is Omicron unstoppable? Yes
388,"Yup, it&#39;s all Omicron&#39;s fault. Nothing to do with the &#39;LET&#39;S PARTY!&#39; mentality in Dec. The slightly informed among us have warned that we would pay for our relaxed xmas by Jan and here it is."

417,"How can you get more than 100%, is this like those high schools that give kids a 4.5 GPA for extra credit. When you calculate the population you normally count tourists as a separate population. This report would be more accurate had it said the area had 100% of it&#39;s population and 4% of visitors vaccinated which shows they need to determine what percentage of the tourists are already vaccinated and work to insure those not already vaccinated are vaccinated. If 90% are vaccinated already and they vaccinate an additional 4%, the be remaining 6% may be of little risk, however if 90% of the tourists are not vaccinated, that 4% is barely going to have an iimpact."

468,It&#39;s more complicated. The percentage of people who refuse to take the vaccine are much higher in developing countries. In some countries people don&#39;t trust the governments and don&#39;t dare to take the vaccines. So it&#39;s not just a distribution and rich against poor countries.

536,"I wondered about this early in the pandemic.  I expected that the additional solid and medical waste would offset any environmental gains from the reduced emissions from lockdowns.  When I go on my walks, I can see a dozen or more masks littered everywhere on a 20 minute walk, even in the creek that local wildlife depend on and that feeds into San Francisco Bay.   I periodically do a neighborhood cleanup walk, but it is worse than ever, and I have to be prepared in advance with gloves, trash bags and recycling bucket, grabber stick, etc.  Also, the hundreds of bums where I live keep approaching me to beg, much too closely.  I hate this, but especially now that they won’t wear the free masks they are given.  One even reversed direction and followed me home when he saw me."
537,"1 million years later, science  people will look at fossilized masks and ask: does this make any sense?"
538,"The average citizen can’t be expected to treat these as medical waste, which requires waste profiling, minimum quantities, hazardous waste shipping, manifests, etc.  It’s prohibitively both expensive and requires technical expertise.    If medical centers and pharmacies would set up collection centers for them, and pay for the incineration, we would use them.  We have these already (US) for unused/expired medicines, so why not expand this system for PPE?  Or maybe our local Haz Waste centers could collect this category, too.   I’m culpable, too, I really need to switch to washable fabric masks, but I have been reusing the same three disposable masks for two years, baking them in full sun for several days in between uses.  I do use washable cotton gloves, mostly to remind me not to rub my eyes or face."
539,"This is what happens in every hospital or research facility, a great deal of medical materials are single-use, and it has to be that way for most cases. I feel like if we move to create some more sustainable materials, in this case, masks, we will have to initially use more plastic, say to create a mask where you only replace a small filter, for example. But then we would have to trust people will use it properly, and I doubt it. In this case, with the masks, I don’t see what else could be better for everyone AND the environment. These masks are needed, particularly for healthcare workers and increasing their price in the name of the environment won’t help, most people struggle to afford them and end up using them more times than it’s recommended."

555,Is there anything we produce that doesn’t totally ruin this planet? <br><br>No? Ok ….. just asking
556,"Put a bounty on anything plastic that is not being properly disposed of. Create a viable and responsible waste stream for plastic in all countries and users of plastic. Put a tax on the people who create it in the first place and especially on the oil companies based on the amount of oil they push down the pipe that is then used to create plastic products. Fisherman who have been pushed out of fishing because of intense plastic pollution could switch to fishing for plastic, pay should be based on a realistic amount so they can continue to fish for plastic. This may help to bring back some of the marine fish and mammals and plants etc., that are being negatively effected by plastic. Incorporate a viable ALTERNATIVE to plastic while phasing out plastic production."
557,It was great while it lasted.
558,"The problem with this whole climate change thing is that it&#39;s basically a negative energy equation, that&#39;s why it&#39;s such a difficult issue to solve. Instead of sucking large quantities of oil out of the ground and burning it to make our lives more comfortable now we&#39;re tasked with the responsibility of expending large quantities of energy to basically sink all that energy back into the ground to save the planet. Even the way they try to sell clean energy projects is backwards, promising people that clean energy will create more jobs. That sounds great but then what are all the people who are working in all those new clean energy jobs going to want to do with the money they&#39;re earning from their clean energy jobs, I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re going to want to go out and consume and then you&#39;ll  also need to offset that consumption. So there really aren&#39;t any easy answers to this problem."
559,"Whoa, whoa, whoa… “We’ve taken to wearing masks?”  I beg to differ- we’ve been ORDERED TO WEAR MASKS!  “People are driving more instead of taking public transportation.”  I own a car and I don’t think I’ve ever thought to myself, well I think I will take a bus instead of my car 🙄"
560,"Recycle reuse washable mask ,help rec over old ones find use for plastics maybe construction of cars boats etc"
561,"It&#39;s funny because it&#39;s all about as effective at its job as the condoms that failed our fathers, and we gave up the world for their misuse too xD."

591,"As always, we&#39;d love to include your questions in our upcoming shows! What would you like to know about the coronavirus pandemic? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23askderrick"">#askDerrick</a>"
592,It is not the &quot;people (who) are becoming very extreme&quot;; The government is extreme. The people are merely reacting in an equal manner.
593,"No- we are not vaccine “hesitant” , we are saying no to a shot that doesn’t do anything to impart immunity or prevent spread of a cold."
594,Not anti-vaccine but anti-mandate.  There is an astronomical difference between the two.
595,They are not anti vaxxers..They are strong free willed people with immune systems.  Love to them all ❤️ Sydney Australia
596,"When someone doesn&#39;t agree with you, dispel, discredit and denounce. Call them all kinds of names and ostracise them. Oldest tricks in the book."
597,I hope all these covid rules and mandates backfire big time on the governments
598,"Maybe this question should be asked: what is the global definition of a vaccine, since it only lasts a few months, then it is merely a medication, with a poor efficiency rate?"
599,Isn’t it insane. A person wants to be a farmer and grow some food to live and somehow this is controversial. The absolute state of things.
600,Fully vaccinated means you will need a new jab every 6 months. Carry on with this craziness.
601,"Wow, so “radical” - someone living in a beautiful place, working the land, and growing their own food. The Germans know where this will end. Their ancestors went through it."
602,it got crazy here in Germany and I am also on the verge to move out
603,I called them conspiracy theorists until I started noticing how many of the things passing my FB page were becoming true...
604,"Oh please give over. I&#39;m no covid denier, nor am I flu denier. I just decided to keep freedom of choice when it comes to my own body and health. Violence, extremism, wth are talking about. I just don&#39;t enjoy coercion and discrimination. I am from France and definitely thinking about emigrating to a place that doesn&#39;t look like a psychiatric ward."
605,"I did the same. Best decision ever. I hope much more people do it, so we create an incentive for freedom."
606,"I don’t like the slant on this. People are deeply concerned by the actions and decisions of their leaders. The pandemic has brought to the fore the real motivations of corporate politics and no longer trust them, nor want to live in a society governed by such immoral machinations"
607,Why did this so called &quot;expert&quot; say &quot;radicalization&quot; over 10 times? <br>People are simply sick of incompetent and clueless governments that make their life harder.
608,Government forcing someone to take a vaccine is EXTREME.
609,Imagine someone with a syringe knocking your door to inject a mysterious subtance into your bloodstream saying this needle is good for you. That&#39;s the type of world we&#39;re living in
610,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxdzLmL22Fs&amp;t=9m16s"">9:16</a> Dear Mr Williams, please also explain the data about how israel who had all their adult got vaccinated and even 3rd jab but still experience 3rd wave, and also please explain why, Back in April Gibraltar had fully vaccinated very close to 100% of its citizens. This month the CDC added Gibraltar to the list of very high risk countries to travel to.  Gibralter&#39;s covid cases are up 2500%."
611,I’ll be with you guys in sprit. Keep fighting and don’t give in! Good bless all of you. 🙏🏼
612,"You know what also can help you not get (a serious case of )covid? Not being obese, not smoking, not drinking, drinking lots of water, not eat processed food and sugary drinks, taking herbs and supplements. Why aren&#39;t those solutions being pushed? 🤔"
613,&quot;Violence&quot;: selling your house and buying a flight ticket
614,"Who came up with the term ‘hesitant’!!!! Have we not spent the last numbers of years clarifying what consent is, and how it is absolute and to be absolutely respected !!!!!???????"
615,Thousands flee Germany leaving thousands of hospital beds for the vaccinated. I hope the vaccinated are happy
616,"&quot;Germans, emigrating to places as far as south America&quot;<br><br><b>Hey, I&#39;ve seen this one, it&#39;s a classic</b>"
617,"The vaccine hesitant groups becoming more radical is in direct proportion to the punitive action of their government. The way your guest speaker kept referring escalation of the protesters made them seem to be the unreasonable party. Far from it, it takes two to tango!"
618,I&#39;m had my two doses of the Pfizer covid vax but hearing that vaccination is being mandated in many nations in Europe doesn&#39;t seem helpful in any way. It would have been understandable if the vaccines eliminated or minimised Covid but this is not what has happened even here in Australia where we are have a vaccination rate of over 90%. Sure it reduces hospitalisations but smoking and alcohol is still allowed so this is still not an argument for a mandate.
619,Germany going back to its roots i see.<br><br>Meanwhile The covid mandates and vaccine passport have been nullified by ONE SINGLE LAWYER in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  <br><br>Feels like im living in opposite world where poor countries make the right decisions while rich countries like Germany and Australia become more authoritarian by day.
620,Im completely in support of this people who are leaving because for how long we are going to live like this from one vaccine to another vaccine until they turn all of us into a vegetarians the way things are going we all have to leave the big cities so we can get our life back free
621,"i don&#39;t blame them at all. i&#39;m from Italy and here the situation is unliveable for the unvaccinated ones, cause of the coercitive and extorsion rules of the goverment: you can&#39;t work without the covid pass, and cannot do any other social activites, so you just can&#39;t live, you are just allow to pay taxes and the bills!if the government does not even grant me the fundamental right to work to support myself and live in dignity at the same time I don&#39;t have to feel obliged to pay any taxes."
622,"I served a mission near the border of Paraguay in Argentina, and I am so grateful for that experience, loving and serving all people. There have been many Germans there for over 100 years, as well as in Argentina and Brazil. Having Peace and Liberty are worth a move, any time! :( So sad for the state of our world, forcing slavery over true liberty and mutual respect for all God&#39;s Family!"
623,We can&#39;t have people living their lives and making their own choices.
624,"&quot;We saw a torchlight march in front of the house of a health minister.  Do we expect to see <b>more acts of violence</b> throughout Germany?&quot;   So, peaceful protest marches are now &quot;acts of violence&quot; in Germany?  And people who want to leave that are considered &quot;radicalized&quot;?  The only thing radicalized in this scenario is the government."
625,"I have enjoyed DW in the past, but it seems to me that it&#39;s not as unbiased as I thought."
626,First you see peacefull families enjoying their freedom then a commentator is saying those are dangerous criminals.. welcome back 1930!
627,"I love how as soon as report starts, it&#39;s starts by calling German citizens, &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;, that&#39;s pretty revealing."
628,"i am stunned why a social scientist portrays a 180° different picture than what i see from many people in my surroundings. I know lots of people who are neither right wing, nor extreme, many also vaccinated, highly educated, did different studies, but oppose measurements and especially ALL oppose the vaccine mandate strongly. <br><br>Maybe i have too few contacts to the less educated and the very old people, but i am still stunned by an almost 180° different picture."
629,"Remember when we were all horrified at the introduction of a &quot;social credit&quot; system in China, where the government can make it impossible for its own citizens to travel or even make purchases if it thinks individuals aren&#39;t upholding the government&#39;s ideals?  Regardless of what you think about the vaccine or online misinformation, the fact that liberal democracies are trying to do the same thing is deeply disturbing.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s &quot;radical&quot; to oppose that at all."
630,Paraguay seems an odd choice if you&#39;re worried about the government being heavy-handed.
631,I&#39;m unvaccinated person too..to me there&#39;s nothing radical about people who refused a politically pedalled impure vaccination incursion .
632,"They always speak about: radicalisation, them, covid-deniers, anti-vaxxers, right-wing extremists etc.. Did you ever discuss their points? I mean, what keeps me from saying that you guys are collateral-damage deniers or something like that? I would never do that because I don&#39;t think you guys do. But that should count for the other side to.. I&#39;m nothing of the earliert mentioned points, I&#39;m vaccinated etc. but I think it should definitely be allowed to discuss about the mandates, sideeffects of the vaccine itself etc."
633,"Please pray for Germany, the government is really wicked"
634,fight for your freedom germany! much love from canada!
635,"I love the normal German people for their honesty and courage but never the politicians  ,"
636,"I&#39;m not against vacination. But hey, how is it possible with record high numbers of COVID. When there are record high numbers of vaccinated people. It doesn&#39;t add up. The health systems had no margins before covid before the pandemic. That&#39;s the problem in most countries. So please, let&#39;s hope the pandemic will be over soon. People will start hesitating after booster shot 4, 5 and 6. Good luck to all of us!"
637,"getting away from crushing taxes, a toxic society and politicians taking more freedoms away every day is a big win regardless of covid"
638,I work in Germany and it&#39;s been troubling last couple of months. Crazy. Now in Croatia I feel so free.
639,They have a point there. It’s also about long working hour and other headaches of living in big towns
640,"I would have subscribed to the channel, if the first interviewee answered any of the questions posed and the second one did not blatantly lie."
641,"If I live in Germany, I would consider many options. It&#39;s absolutely crazy in Germany"
642,I live in Canada currently and we are going to list our house in the spring and move if things don&#39;t change quickly.
643,"I would say the only thing radical here are the restriction measures being imposed in Germany, Austria and some other radical governments around the world."
644,"You should only trust &quot;experts&quot; if they have the transparency to tell what their research is based upon, and who are the ones who funded it. Always ask questions, don&#39;t be mislead just because the person is called an &quot;expert&quot;."
645,First time in history that the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who haven&#39;t taken it.
646,"Thank you for the honest answer to this viewer question in the end. Interestingly, more and more we suddenly hear a certain messaging surrounding the vaccines, as from the science correspondent in your Video, marked by phrases like &quot;we hoped&quot;, &quot;we do know now&quot;, &quot;maybe for a long while the vaccine will protect you&quot; and so on. I do agree with your science correspondent regarding the &quot;messaging issue&quot; by the officials, though one may find more honest descriptions for that ;) Either way, what is striking here is that obviously, we did NOT know everything about the vaccines right from the start of the campaign, yet to this day one gets bashed and called names in pointing this out. So this unscientific sentiment, this hybris has to stop and we have to trust our fellow people to make the right decisions on themselves without willful deception."
647,I want to leave my country but without vacxx I can&#39;t even ride a plane 😢
648,What about those of us who can&#39;t take it because of medical reasons
649,I really feel for freedom loving Germans. Its clear that totalitarianism is an inescapable predisposition in Germanic people&#39;s.
650,When there are masses protesting around the world 🌎 I find that the government and others need to consider why this is happening. Yhe governments haven&#39;t been upfront and honest about many situations in past. When you reflect at the history of the deceit it is very justified to feel betrayed.
651,Sad to hear! I wish freedom for the hunted!! people need to be able to make their own decision! The ones great nation of Germany is gone.
652,its outrageous the professor kept saying &quot;radicals right wing&quot; its a question of living in a liberal country!
653,The Himalayas are beautiful place...the small Himalayan villages have never been affected by covid!
654,&quot;Tyranny of the majority&quot;. This is one of the things the founding fathers were trying to avoid when they wrote the Constitution. Thomas Jefferson wrote of it explicitly.
655,"&quot; Conspiracy theories&quot;?? DW, your &quot;reporting&quot; is at the level of Facebook memes... you guys really have no shame, do you?"
656,I was resident in Greece but left the moment the government introduced 100E a month fines for not getting more compulsory boosters.
657,"Paraguay is generally a safe country though it has its many dangers in the form of petty crime, violent crime, smuggling, money laundering, corrupt police and many other. Just apply basic precaution measures and you should be fine."
658,Freedom is never free. If they have more freedom in Paraguay ( which I actualy believe ) they gonna lack on other things. You gotta pick your battles. Good Luck to everybody all over the world 🌎
659,"I&#39;m also emigrating next month because of COVID lockdowns. I refuse to give up my young and vital years of my life because a bunch of boomers don&#39;t want me to leave my house, or have a job, or call me a danger to society. The &#39;expert&#39; in this video, of course, paints me as extreme-right. I know better, the professor should instead take a look in the mirror since I&#39;m not the one advocating to keep everyone locked in and subject to seemingly arbitrary rules. Yeah, good luck with that. I&#39;m out of here. Ya&#39;ll lost your damn mind."
660,Well done Germans. Live and let live
661,"Good job, right decision"
662,"Is it not important, that for survival, we have groups that react and think differently when faced with a sickness or threat? Sometimes when you leave the herd you get eaten by the wolf but sometimes you don&#39;t fall off the cliff with the rest of the herd. Either way some life goes on."
663,And they still refuses to discuss those who&#39;ve had and are still dealing with the adverse reactions from the treatment..
664,"I&#39;d rather Listen to nobel price winner,mRNA platform inventor and most specialist working 30+ years with virology than ANY news reporter👋 I know you reporters feel bad, so you have to call scientists conspiracy nuts🤣"
665,I&#39;d love to move to Germany but this is keeping me from moving. I want to live in a free country that respects basic human rights!
666,this is why i hear alot more german speaking in sweden lately :D the weather isnt really vacation weather now :P
667,Seems like history is repeating itself.
668,"That pastor &quot;I had a vision from God that I should move to Paraguay. Also, a Facebook group for people who want to move to Paraguay mentioned it.&quot;"
669,"Great and brave move, you are the lime light to shed over many looking to migrate into freedom and peace.  GOD bless you families.  Love you all with our prayers and won&#39;t be long before New Birthing on Earth by God Almighty."
670,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxdzLmL22Fs&amp;t=0m08s"">0:08</a> also you confused refusing the vaccine and refusing to wear mask. They are two different things. Not to take the vaccine can also mean to wear masks and don´t touch stuff."
671,Keep fighting the good fight 💪
672,The spread of Covid-19 can depend upon population density.  Some members of the population can be quite dense.
673,I find it weird when even the pandemic is on its ending stage now some EU governments like France or Germany are still cracking down whit crazy rules and restrictions like it is still March 2020.
674,I love this!! We need to remember that we are all human and no one absolutely NO ONE! Should dictate your life!! I salute  people that are taking charge of their lives  and not giving into a tyrannical society.
675,"I&#39;m also evaluating to leave Germany if they will insist on vaccinating my son (8 years old).<br>I&#39;m a mathematician and I love science, but I have big eyes about what is happening. It is a theater, a show. Even a simple student of medicine would not make such enormous errors, against the logic and against the most simple common sense."
676,I like how DW gives more airtime to knowledgeable people to have the last say. Hopefully gone are the days where 10+% of the news is uninformed &quot;people on the street&quot; and another 30% given to denialists in the interest of &#39;balance&#39;. Now see us closer to 50% reporting summaries and 50% a platform for the leading experts in the issue.
677,I would like to know how the people of paraguy feel about these new immigrants? What will they do if Paraguy makes the same corona guidelines as Germany?
678,Austrians will be doing this as well i should imagine.
679,"Great, I&#39;m &quot;fully&quot; vaccinated, but positive serological test should be admitted as proof of convalescence. I missed my &quot;positive window&quot; a month ago when I noticed I have no taste or smell after a &quot;cold&quot; and had a negative pcr test now I&#39;m restricted from cetain places because I&#39;m not boosted since I don&#39;t need a booster. Starting to feel like boosters are being pushed on us without any rhime or reason 🤔"
680,"What a shocker, Germany being divisive amongst it&#39;s populous!"
681,"There are a lot of small 1200 and tiny town 64 in rural prairies of USA that could use more younger folks. Not a lot of COVID panic. Lots of decendents of Germans already out there.  Conservative communities, NOT tolerant of radicalizing politics."
682,"I understand migrating for time, growing food, escaping the city because I wanna do it myself, vaccine mandates are a result of poor initial Covid outbreak management but we are here now, we need to finally end this, coming from Africa I know very well about vaccine mandates, we&#39;ve been doing it all our lives."
683,"If I may. It&#39;s sad to see a journalist not correcting this professor of socialization and conflict research, for deliberate negative use of the word, ( Radical ) and ( Radicalisation ). They can just as easily  define a healthy break away from a bad habit such as smoking. He&#39;s playing to the narrative and relying on people&#39;s ignorance to induce fear and rejection of their fellow man."
684,Its redicelous taking the human rights/freedom  away!!!   we live definetly in end times!!!  But never jab for me!!!
685,Paraguayos are Good People and it’s a beautiful country.
686,"That’s a failed state , people leave craving for freedom"
687,No covid deniers but tyrany fighters
688,Why would you stay in Germany if you have the Money to leave? It sucked even before Covid.
689,"From the sounds of it, it has to do with working less more than covid restrictions.  If covid restrictions were a problem than there are countries in  Europe which have very relaxed policies.  Belarus, Sweden, Denmark and Norway are few examples."
690,So sad to see what’s happening to my home
691,"As always, we&#39;d love to include your questions in our upcoming shows! What would you like to know about the coronavirus pandemic? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23askderrick"">#askDerrick</a>"
692,"This is one of the things that makes me proud to be Brazilian 🇧🇷<br>Vaccines work, masks work!<br>I wish more people in the US and other countries in Europe could also reach great levels of vaccinated people as we did<br>It just proves that the average Brazilian believe in the power of vaccines"
693,"I live in Brazil and have experienced this first hand, Brazilians should be proud of their institutions. Unfortunately the fear of bringing infected people to work is creating increased poverty. Hopefully Covid burns out like the Spanish flu and people can get back to work."
694,&quot;Brazilians believe in vaccines&quot;. Many Americans can learn from this.
695,"I&#39;m praying for healing, safety, and prosperity, for Brazil. 🇧🇷 God bless you always. Stay optimistic in these pandemic days of covid19. 💓 💟"
696,I am happy for the Brazil’s people.
697,Brazil always amazes me...their Hispanic neighbors have something conflicting going on but Brazilians are resilient and always optimistic
698,Clear and precise explanation from the expert!
699,"I&#39;m just here for my dose of Derrick, my breakout hero of the pandemic.  You should do a show with just him."
700,"It is a very a nice development, well-done my beloved country Brazil, let be vaccinated"
701,Bravo Brazil.
702,"Yes, but we shouldn’t forget that is summertime now in Brazil. Wait for Carnaval and we will have a different picture. Having said that, well done to the 99% who got vaccinated."
703,Well done Brazil 🇧🇷
704,"Derrick, may you explain the difference between vector and subunit vaccines?<br><br>They have been mostly compared with inactivated virus vaccines, but comparing them with vector vaccines is the most confusing to me."
705,As a Brazilian citizen Fabio really said very well what is going on here.
706,"looking at the numbers the infections and deaths still appear to be linked in Brazil, its just that the wave has come to an end.<br>vaccines normally have a limited affect on infections and a greater affect on deaths so the lines to start to separate but that is not the case in Brazil"
707,It seems like at the moment there are a few different countries in the southern hemisphere doing very well at the moment whilst they are having their summer time.<br><br>And 6 months ago plenty of countries in the northern hemisphere were doing ok.
708,Omicron is coming for most of the population around the world if your around others . It&#39;s not about if you will get it but when . Also the vaccines more than likely create more asymptomatic cases which can lead more transmission as you never new you had it and many are not going to test without symptoms . The good thing early in this variant is if you are vaccinated and especially boosted it appears symptoms will be mild . Another factor for Brazil they had allot of infection complimented by vaccination to boost immunity . It appears that 4 to 6 months is all you get from maybe from  symptomatic immunity and after a year you have little left . So a seasonal vaccination probly timed before major holidays maybe helpful
709,"As a Brazilian I have to say that this is very accurate and informative. Our public health system took a heavy toll, but thanks to our historical efforts in making vaccines reach all over the country and yearly vaccinations for all kinds of diseases, it was relatively easy to convince people to get their shots.<br><br>The Federal government didn&#39;t want to buy vaccines, but in the end it worked out well with support from state governors and we took the opportunity to buy all kinds of vaccines. Most Brazilian capitals now have at least a 60% vaccine coverage and we are close to reach the vaccination threshold to start getting rid of this nightmare.<br><br>Hugs from Brazil!"
710,Yes we love to be vaccinated ..!!! As tropical place vaccination is something that we are really used to
711,Bravo!👏
712,"One thing to consider is that Brazil is probably the country with the highest rates of people who had Covid with people vaccinated from Covid and people who had covid and then were also vaccinated. <br><br>Studies show that types of antibodies created are different and having BOTH is ideal from a purely &quot;shield&quot; pov (too risky to get Covid to build immunity, don&#39;t do it)"
713,That&#39;s good news!💚🌷✌
714,Brazil is not as remotely connected as North America and Europe. So they can&#39;t Zoom their way past the pandemic as many have in more connected economic blocks. Brazil has a lot more of the middle and working classes in alternate economies that are vulnerable to disruptive forces like the pandemic.
715,Study in Brazilian town shows 95% efficacy of Sinovac&#39;s vaccine in reducing death by COVID-19.CoronaVac is the most prevalent vaccine in Brazil thanks to Sinovac&#39;s cooperation with the Butantan Institute. The vaccine accounts for almost 80 percent of all the doses applied in Brazil.
716,Question: How long does the boost works?

718,so good to see that brazil changed their opinion about vaccines
719,It’s only a matter of time for omicron to take over
720,"For all citizens in the world, please to inform that the world can only revive if the riches country will cooperate in combating the virus, now, resources are highly valuable especially among the poor countries which are not sufficient in buying more vaccines, so if the other country is behind with vaccination how can we conquer all of these if the virus is still mutating around. The global economy is much affected, many are jobless, many are scared, many are panicking, more struggling for many poor people. It is always our priority to help one another, sharing vaccines or caring procedures will help."

759,"As always, we&#39;d love to include your questions in our upcoming shows! What would you like to know about the coronavirus pandemic? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23askderrick"">#askDerrick</a>"
760,"I appreciate the real statements of the nurses they included at the beginning of the video. Those are the hardships that healthcare workers face throughout the world. The physician that spoke about what could be done to lessen the workload and create a higher incentive to become a nurse were spot on. I work at a hospital in the ER, so I feel that I can say what I have to say about my hospital, but cannot speak for others. The first thing I have to say is the workload. Over the past few months, we have seen an explosion of patients. There is a combination of people who have COVID, people who are very sick because they did not want to leave their house to avoid COVID which made them more sick than ever, and people who think COVID has passed and decide to come into the ER for acute things. This caused an overflow of patients into our hospital which we have never seen before. We had gone from freaking out over 3-5 patients in the waiting room with 1 hour wait times to it being a regular day with 25+ patients waiting for 4 or more hours. We are not used to the amount of people that come in, so we become overworked. Another reason why we are overworked is because people leave to become travel nurses. The amount of work you do at our hospital is most likely going to be the same at the next hospital down the street. So why do people become travel nurses? A huge increase in pay. A person would go from making roughly $32 an hour to $100 an hour. They do not have to stress about the travel part too because just about every hospital in our area are in need of nurses. If people don&#39;t apply, you hire an agency. That&#39;s where travel nurses come in. That comes to my last point - pay. There is really no point in staying as a full time employee when you could be making 2 to 3 times the pay as a travel nurse. Yes it will not be forever, but it will be for a while. So why not take advantage of it? All your other coworkers are doing it. So now the ER is unrecognizable from how many veteran nurses that reached their pay cap left to be filled by a new nurse making twice as much as you. That&#39;s the reality our team faces in the ER. A solution for employee retention is very simple yet so hard because the CEO&#39;s need to stay rich and powerful and have influence over you. That solution is a higher pay rate. Even going an extra $3 an hour for your base pay rate could go distances. Unfortunately the reality is either no one has thought of that yet, or someone high up is rejecting that solution. Whatever the bureaucracy is going on up top, more nurses leave just to be filled by unfamiliar faces."
761,"You appreciate workers with money, not words!!"
762,I&#39;m a nurse in primary care Australia for the last ten years. Nursing since 1983.Last 2 years have added  heavily to our workload too. I&#39;m retiring early. I can&#39;t imagine how the nurses in acute care have coped.
763,"I work as a patient care tech at a hospital. Despite the rise of the omicron covid, I keep pushing through and try to take care of patients as best as I can"
764,"Thank you to all healthcare, and other essential, workers during this pandemic.  We know you are exhausted, and are grateful for your altruism, sacrifices and perseverance.  I, for one, follow all recommended precautions, it’s the minimum we can do to protect these workers who are dedicated to saving as many lives as possible.  Let’s hope the huge number of Omicron cases will at least require less hospital and intensive care and provide the widespread immunity we need to move on to the endemic stage.  Maybe ongoing COVID boosters, combined with annual flu vaccines, will eventually be enough to manage this new virus if it truly becomes less dangerous."
765,Omicron is the mildest variant so far its a good sign that the virus is weakening. It also spreads much faster which could ultimately speed up an end to the pandemic.
766,"Treating nurses with more respect and not like we are as disposable as the gloves we wear would be appreciated as well as including us in decision making.  I will be forced for the 4th time to be redeployed to another unit for this damn virus without being given any options, except to quit my job of 28 years."
767,"In my situation I was various times hospalized, (not for covid) but other problems and operations. Looking at how I felt about the nurses?? I adored them, was VERY GRATEFUL, ALWAYS ABOUT WHAT THEY DID FOR ME.. I think that many patients are even VERY VERY VERY grateful for all the help they received during being hospalized. (by covid or what other diseases)!!"
768,"Some of the profits that Big Pharma makes from covid vaccines could go toward every healthcare worker on the planet and in the field as an expression of gratitude....if not this, then at least put something back into the community as a sign of respect."
769,"As far as I know the mild symptoms of omikron with less hospitalstations make it much easier..... what makes it worse is letting go the health care workers due to not complying to the vaccine mandate. And of course mishandling of money, privatisation of hospitals and not improving the work condition and salary of health care workers already in the years before covid.  Asking nurses from India to fill in is just another way to kick the local health care workers in the butt."
770,Sorry not only  nurses but  all health care worker are in danger
771,"What makes things really hard for healthcare workers is being very understaffed due to firing all the healthcare workers for refusing the experimental vaccine. In New York alone they let 30,000 healthcare workers go. That puts an incredible amount of stress on those that are still working, increasing burnout, and making more workers quit."
772,"A new study published on the preprint server bioRxiv assesses the antiviral activity of stenoparib against four severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs). This study also focuses on the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant by a combination of stenoparib and remdesivir.<br><br>The researchers of the current study also evaluated the inhibitory action of a combination of stenoparib and remdesivir against the Alpha variant. When combined, the drugs acted synergistically and plaque inhibition increased to over 90%"
773,It&#39;s not true that UK ICU nurses look after 1 patient  - it is 2 - in the wards where non-ventilated patients are looked after you could be caring for 6 to 10 patients. Furthermore nurses&#39; pay has not improved for the past ten years as it doesn&#39;t keep up with inflation or living costs. There was a shortage of 40K nurses before the pandemic and the current shortage is 100K nurses in the NHS.
774,Pay them more &amp; money for DYING TO HELP OTHERS!!!  Their lives mean way more than a common business man who can only help himself &amp; his family.  These nurses care for 100&#39;s of patient&#39;s a year!!!
775,Healthcare workers are important 24/7 365!  Thank you to all the healthcare workers for all the selfless sacrifices you guys have made!
776,"Theyshould just stop one day... One day, and maybe our hypocritical societies will start reconsidering what values we have..."
777,Nurses are the number one thing patients need in a hospital. Nurses and teachers should be paid far more worldwide to attract and retain the good ones. We need them. Spain is trying to treat their nurses as poorly as the USA does.
778,"It’s funny how hospitals main service has a nursing care and most of the monies go to administrative costs…. The business model is like that of charitable foundations… very little of the resources go to actual care, just pays the top heavy  administrative salaries…"
779,"Another record set today Dec 29th. According to worldometer France is leading with +170,807, US +159,608 and UK +129,471.  Indonesia is lagging behind at +278 and China lost today tally at +209. Total cases in China since pandemy 101,486. With this figure China fails to take the lead. Note that currently USA  successfully maintains number one with 53,979,608 cases."

788,If they bother lowering taxes they would have more staff .... why do you think there is a surplus in India ?<br><br>The german govt asks employers to pay double the NET income given to the employees.
789,"Indian nurses trying to give advice to European nurses? Is that a joke? The country that had funeral pyres running 24/7 and people in tents on the side of the road clutching their oxygen tanks?<br><br>It&#39;s also not compelling when you complain that a nurse needs to deal with TWO ventilated patients instead of ONE. They are not literally pumping oxygen to them with a hand crank. They are periodically watching their vitals.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure about these single payer healthcare systems, but in the US, you are guaranteed $100k starting and basically have complete job security as there are never enough nurses. It&#39;s near impossible to get fired even if you are a bad nurse."
790,The salary is still low.. we appreciate thanks but we also need more than that for our families.
791,"Travel nurses in the US are contracting their labor for 5,000 -10,000 dollars a week.Many have left their regular employers to travel and those able to retire or step down to other less taxing work have done so."

823,"Dear healthcare workers, no I will not thank you for doing your job. I&#39;m not an &quot;essential worker&quot; but I have often given more than 100% to give a service and to get paid for it. Life is not always easy, sometimes we have to sweat blood and tears to get food on our table and to provide for our community and our family. I was never given any preferential treatment when I worked long hours of overtime. I do my job because I love it and it is rewarding in more ways than one. I chose my profession because I have a passion for it and I understand that many times it&#39;s going to be challenging. No one ever clapped in the balcony for me and I&#39;m not going to do that for anyone else just because they&#39;re doing the job they&#39;re supposed to be doing. What angers me to the core is how you are expecting everyone else to give up our careers, to end up on wage-supplements, to have our businesses and the future of our families ruined because of you. While you continue to do your job, millions of people have lost theirs. Show some respect and humility. I&#39;ve had enough of this narrative. It&#39;s been two years, give it a break and try to show some empathy towards others. You think you&#39;ve had a difficult 2 years?

One of the alleged reasons for that was the lack of available tests or lab confirmation. On those periods it was estimated the number of death records expressing just the aforementioned reason to be up to 10 times bigger than records confirming &#39;COVID-19&#39; as the cause."
862,Counting deaths caused by infectious diseases during epidemics is very difficult if not impossible. The death toll given by authorities will always be an estimate at best.  There will always be some or many cases not reported by families of the affected people due to rush of events and bureaucratic hassles involved. This has to be accepted as being beyond human control. India has handled this covid pandemic better than many advanced countries.
863,"In the UK if you test positive and pass away after 28 days after the first positive test you are not counted in the figures. You hear stories of people in hospital for several months with covid and recover, they are rightly celebrated but had they passed away after 29 days you would not be included in the death toll. Not only is this disrespectful to the patient but also to the health care professionals who fight to keep them alive."
864,"People are dying from lung cancer,heart attacks,strokes and even appendicitis deaths are on the rise cause People can&#39;t get treated for these diseases in the hospital because of all the covid patients."
865,"Too many nations/states have found ways around looking &quot;bad&quot; by truthfully reporting Covid-related deaths, or even rates of Covid infection. Without accurate data, we can&#39;t know, but if it&#39;s not at least twice the official total, I&#39;d be stunned."
866,Condolences to those who died because of covid 19😥😥for me Cambodia 🇰🇭
867,"Crisis of trust, indeed !<br>Worst during covid, though started since 2007 and getting very bad since 2016."
868,In my country Egypt my mother died by covid health authorities only  count in government hospitals and other private hospitals are not counted
869,"If we have had the internet during polio, we would still be walking around with leg braces. The internet has made everyone an expert in misinformation."
870,"In India only people who have death certificate registered are counted, the actual number will be more than double 🤔"
871,"It was surprising to see significant discrepancies between excess mortality and official COVID deaths in many Eastern European countries, not only in Belarus and Russia but even in Poland, Czechia, Lithuania etc, as if someone is trying to paint a better picture."
872,It would be good to know how many people who died with or from Covid were unvaccinated versus those who were vaccinated. That would bring more clarity to this debate.
873,"For excess mortality you have to factor all those who would have died in daily car accidents,  but didn&#39;t because they worked from home, and all those sorts of changes  then add those on to excess mortality to figure out Covid deaths.  I heard some doctors didn&#39;t write Covid on the death certificate because they would have to fill in a lot more paperwork and some undertakers would not take people who had died of Covid."
874,"One simple example of under reporting deaths can be seen in US daily Covid totals. Many US states like Florida list 1 or 0 deaths daily regardless of how many die. DeSantis was able to restrict death &amp; infection counts. But many other states do the same, simply having blanks where there should be numbers. India had over 5 million deaths but reported 1/10th that amount likely for political reasons. China had a lot of deaths in the early days of the  pandemic but reported obviously low numbers. 20 million plus is a much more accurate approximation, but it could even be as much as 30 million."
875,"It is absolutely true , in India the death rate during covid was much more higher ."
876,"True it is difficult, here in Indonesia, back in February 2020, I attended more funeral that what I used to back in years. Even  I read more obituaries in February 2020 than what I used to in 2019. Nobody knows whether those were covid or not.<br><br>But, me and my several friends indeed experience mild cold symptoms two weeks after attending some of these funerals. I did not even wear mask when I went to office back in February and March 2020. But, I knew it seemed there was cold outbreaks among my officemates.<br><br>But still, my experience in Feb-Mar 2020 was nothing in comparison with June-July-August 2021 in Indonesia. The death announcements and obituaries at Local Mosques and Whatsapp Groups were indeed skyrocketing. My GERD was badly triggered during this time due to excessive stress."
877,My boyfriend had two daughters who died from COVID they are so young and I&#39;m scared that if its gonna happens to me and my daughter but I guess people just don&#39;t it take seriously at all smh
878,"Yes. Many deaths are not counted, also the contagions, it doesn&#39;t enter in the tallies Coz the healthy system is so stressed. No reliable data."
879,I lost my sense of smell for 3 months. About 9 months to fully regain and feel like I was able to smell things like I remembered them.
880,DW gives BBC a run for its money with quality insight
881,"In my country, many opted not to disclose the fact if their family member died of covid19. Because that means the deceased could not be burried in their family grave.<br><br>Besides, don&#39;t forget people who died of other diseases, but due to inability to access healthcare with hospitals being overcrowded by covid patients. Like my uncle who was robbed of his routine monthly treatment due to no space or bed or facility available anymore. They should be considered among the victims as well."
882,Some trust issues are to be expected. Though the saddest thing with this pandemic is how some bad actors have sown mistrust. It has made the whole thing so much worse.
883,"Here in the Philippines, it was a different case.  There&#39;s a possibility that COVID deaths should be lower as many non-COVID deaths were  declared by local hospitals as COVID-related to get cash assistance from the government, and the bereaved family to get free of hospital charges."
884,I have hardly found anyone I meet or talk to who has not lost someone they know from this pandemic.
885,"At least 4 to 6 million dead in India not 400,000<br><br>In a normal year 83% of the dust in India go unreported<br><br>It&#39;s reasonable to take the death toll of India and multiply by 5 or by 10 and some biostatisticians estimate that it should be by 20<br><br><br>The average household in India has 10 people and the average household has at least one dead usually three"
886,"Numbers that exceed expected averages, can fairly safely be assumed as being a result of Covid."
887,We are not being told the whole story so how do we answer these great questions
888,"Since our government and CDC doesn’t recognize natural immunity, what’s going to happen to all those “break through” cases from Omnicon that’s sweeping around the world, will they require those break through cases to take the booster since Natural immunity is not recognized?"
889,"We can only try to see trends from the numbers. This happened with Spanish flu as well, once the medical community got overwhelmed record keeping wasn&#39;t as important as taking care of patients. Also the collateral deaths due to people with other issues not having good care and dying,   due to covid cases taking up beds, are not counted as part of the event."
890,MANY thanks for your continuous reporting on this deadly pandemic 👏👏🙌🙌👏
891,"We are witnessing a unique event in our lifetimes. Something that brings us together in sorrow, but politics introduced into matters of medicine are trying to tear us apart."
892,"We do not for sure the exact numbers of sickness, illness and infection that could be as high as hundred of millions accordingly death and mortality rate is rather within expected rates.<br><br>We do know for sure that covid is a direct cause of death among those who have died.<br><br>Not to forget that several other infectious and chronic diseases have been associated with covid with those who have died.<br><br>Yet WHO, FAO and China should take full responsibility for the unforgettable sin......"
893,We are thousands of times more apt at collecting data of people in the digital domain than we are at maintaining real world records.
894,I have always multiplied it by 5. Imo minimum.
895,When my dad passed away from COPD and stomach ulcer which was infected. The doctor said that he died from covid19. He didn&#39;t die from covid19
896,This is really sad🙏
897,"The best statement I have heard about the Pandemic.!  CRISIS of TRUST.!!!   Thanks, Ben.!  Merry Christmas..."
898,True figure can be said after few years.
899,"count x10 including other uncured illnesses (because full hospitals), mental health problems ( addiction, suicide), starvation, ecc..."
900,The best example of inaccurate data is India with the population still the death figure were 2 digit numbers!!
901,We should also count people dying of hunger and suicide due to lockdown.
902,@DWNEWS Can you investigate the deaths post Coronavirus? Many are dying after coronavirus treatment and coming home.
903,"I’d like to see Derrick talk to Dr John Campbell, can you make that happen DW ?"
904,"With chronic illnesses, I highly doubt it&#39;s the patients that are worried and don&#39;t go for screening or checkups. At least here in the UK, if you want an appointment unrelated to covid, it can take weeks to even get one at your GP, then further weeks to get to the specialist. They keep advertising that the &quot;NHS wants to help you&quot; but that&#39;s not how I felt when I was turned away from my GP after numerous failed call attempts. They are so overwhelmed (obsessed!) with covid that they are harming  people."
905,"Too nice subtitles ( trusts crisis) in every sides of this epidemic publishing &amp; complications...medical abilities failed completely, medical drugs &amp;(supposed)vaccines procedure companies are Sankey in their&#39;s benefits 😳"
906,"I know exactly what you going through, I have experience it myself. I got back my sense of smell and taste with Dr Isibor Herbal supplement, after applying for 3 weeks I&#39;m so happy 😊💯"
907,Does anyone have a link to that data or article referenced?  Or does anyone know if there was a confidence level for the extrapolated data?
908,"How about deaths from drug overdoses, deep depression, suicides?"
909,Pelo fim da pandemia 🫀🙏
910,The information presented and conclusions reached amount to just more tactical confusion....... I&#39;m just duly notating it and moving on.
911,Very sad 😔  so many people died all over the world 🌎 🙏
912,That&#39;s not true. In Philippines the dead cannot be released for burial without being tested. And positive or not during lockdown they are cremated automatically. But if negative and not locked down then the relatives can have the full body for wake with immediate family only.
913,"Capitalism is the commodification of human experience, while politics and economic theories commodify our struggle and growth."
914,Just look at excess deaths. Compare to a five year average before it started.
915,"In India alone, over 5 million died from the covid.."
916,In a way during this pandemic we are all dead I consider these pandemic years as not being fully alive. When I do die subtract all the lockdown time as actual life lived. NO MORE FEAR OR CONTROL PLEASE AND THANKS. Math test! If someone lives 80 years and is locked down for 3 of them what percentage of said persons life was controlled?
917,Oncology patient in Russia was making surgery at themselves at home. Excess mortality is not just from COVID-19. At least in Russia.
918,I know this.  Is this pandemic an excuse not to treat others with treatable illnnesses or sicknesssss? I&#39;m just wondering.
919,2 million in India and 1 million in US alone. Worldwide at least 8 million people died.
920,Oh mercyful God 🙏🙏🙏 have MERCY 😢😢!!!! Death tool must be higher cause whose counting those from poor nation????!
921,Oh my 💔
922,🥺😢💔
923,Mass media depends directly on its investors that propagate what is profitable for them only
924,"80% die with and not from, the impact is therefore much smaller, but lockdowns, cause hunger obesity stress violence extremsim… so they have a bad impact too"
925,Your Report about loss of taste and smell is apparently related too Zinc Deficiency!.....as attested too by several specialist Doctors on Youtube who have been discussing this in their online Tutorials/Reports about the ongoing Pandemic and the complicated information...and you could not be rubbished for not knowing that as their is so much going on the distractions are increasing all the time....and some of the information is only for the most dedicated individuals....too make sense of..
926,&quot;&quot;For the first time in history the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who refuse to take it.&quot;
927,It is strange that unlike India the Western rich countries don&#39;t show deaths or give out numbers of deaths. Only India is shown over and over again. Please do check how India has got through and over 2 waves of Covid -19 and its variant.
928,Dying &#39;&#39;with&#39;&#39; covid and dying &#39;&#39;of&#39;&#39; covid.  Thin line.
929,Maybe it&#39;ll be the opposite. Heard people say stuff like. They are exaggerating death totals and infections. Even if a person dies from a car crash with COVID. It&#39;ll count as a COVID death.
930,"I was reported Covid19 positive on the 14th of Dec.2021 but I never had any problem of loss of sense of smell or sense of taste. But I had runny nose, moderate fever, body pain but not severe. I continued with my own traditional medicines and now I am fully recovered."
931,death tolls are always an estimate. It&#39;s  like guessin how long is a piece of rope.
932,I can tell you how bad because I have lost 9 family members in one year....last one a week ago. Youngest 11 oldest 84. Usa.
933,"It depends where in the chain of recording you intercept the statistics. i.e it was reported by UK Government that my local area had thousands of cases, the local authority reported there were hundreds hospitalised, so because I know many nursing staff at my local hospital I went direct to them at the time, who reported just 8 cases being treated on 2 wards throughout the whole hospital.  The UK always report thousands of cases and insist the NHS is at breaking point, but all of the Specialised &#39;nightingale&#39; hospitals they equipped were never used and have since be dismantled. Who do we trust?"
934,It’s almost like we are gonna end up with one adult alive and millions of children!! <br>Like the pied piper!!
935,Worst news channel by far. They sure know how to cause panic and make it out to seem that everything’s really bad that

938,For the sake of His sorrowful Passion have mercy on us and on the whole world.
939,Can we trust media ? 2 years of this bull*hit maybe enough ? Happy Christmas by the way and life is continuing 🙃
940,A rough calculation formula =<br>Total death - Average death / by month or year
941,Statistics are released according to the narrative. Why not mention the hidden numbers of those suffering from adverse side effects.
942,RIP 🤲

1033,"I don&#39;t think that capitalism can really be blamed for the inequities in India. After all India fully embraced socialism/communism post independence and only recently liberalised its economy in the post cold war era. Thus India never really experienced the rapid industrialisation and wealth increase that the &quot;Asian tigers&quot; (South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Singapore) did in the post war era.

1043,"I have a 8 year old in my extended family and they have been homeschooled the last two years. They are actually doing quite well!

1073,"number of lives saved is a meaningless number... years of quality of life added (or taken away) is a more beneficial metric. imo, not worth saving the 1% of the population at risk of corona hospitalization (most of whom are already severely ill or close to the end of their lives), if it means ruining lives of many more healthy people with decades left to live."

1150,"How does this translate into hospitalization ??? It&#39;s the common cold,otherwise ??"
1151,Can they not get it at their GPS office instead of waiting in the cold for hours? Here in Ireland everyone over 16 can get the booster that way if they want.
1152,Omicron is 75% now in the USA.
1153,More cases and less hospitalizations!!!!! Omicron might be the new vaccine.
1154,…that the governments are good with numbers we can see on how they handle our money…💚
1155,"That was interesting to watch.  The journalist kept asking questions to the expert while throwing her opinion into the question.  She says: its going to lead to 75000 deaths and many more hospitalizations, the expert says we cant look at those models because they have been over estimating severe cases and that severity cant be modeled, she turns around and contradicts him leading into the next question.   Makes you think DW has already made up its mind about what it wants to say..."
1156,DW NEWS You&#39;re about 18 months late this was a conspiracy remember.
1157,Cases BUT WHAT ABOUT HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATHS??

1166,So is the world going to ban flights from the UK? Or Europe?

1168,"Based on South Africa reports, do you even need booster??"
1169,We in the England will have a drink for you on New Year&#39;s day
1170,"Very misleading.  All doom and gloom. In South Africa the reality is now obvious - mild, even without booster."
1171,"Yet the deaths keep falling, weird!"
1172,I dont know why there is ease in Asia and middle east on corona virus restrictions.
1173,Masks are still very important... I don&#39;t understand why so many people in the UK (in this video) walk around without masks even though vaccinated!
1174,I prefer Celsius over Fahrenheit.

1290,The framing here is inhuman.
1291,Dont you dare condescendingly presume to speak for me about ANYTHING .
1292,Can you blame people for being so skeptical? The way that governments have been behaving is quite concerning. Trying to force vaccines on people over a pathogen that is not very deadly to begin with is indeed baffling.

1295,"Portugal was never on my travel/migration list before. But since this pandemic, they had proven how capable and reliable they are, practically winning over my interest."
1296,"Portugal has been a world leader in the area of public health for quite a while. It’s response to what was a widespread drug abuse problem has been lauded by public health specialists worldwide for example. Portugal treats drug addiction as a medical, not a law enforcement problem, and its success in reduction of drug-related crimes, and state-of-the-art treatments has been the subject of numerous news stories and articles."
1297,"I love the Portuguese, they are very sensible and charming people and I am not surprised that they are ahead of the game with Covid. <br>Even though we have a new variant [Omicron] it&#39;s till very important that near to 100% of people are fully vaccinated. This will avoid hospitalisations and deaths because people will not get seriously ill enough to go to hospital.<br><br>The same precautions need to be followed, as was/is needed form the very beginning of the pandemic.<br><br>God luck Portugal."
1298,Good to see that there are still countries that act civil and care about one another.
1299,"She is right, it&#39;s the dynamics of the disease,  rate and acceleration of spread, that count. Understand and respond appropriately to that and the disease is manageable."
1300,Too bad the UK government  does not pay attention to other governments and neighbors. Portugal is an amazing place.
1301,Well done Portugal - AN EXAMPLE TO THE WORLD!!! I hope this will open peoples eyes regarding vaccination!!!
1302,Congratulations Portugal!!!
1303,Good for these parents!
1304,that&#39;s what a responsible government should do. don&#39;t just pander to the whims of politics and the white man&#39;s mistaken entitled human rights and declare &quot;independence day&quot; the fight against covid judging by the past 2 years is not ending anytime soon. caution is the rule of the day
1305,"Well done Portugal, that&#39;s how a civilised society should work, by everyone pulling together. 👍"
1306,I&#39;m scheduled to be traveling to Portugal Dec 28-Jan 9 ;(    How restrictive are their lockdowns? Will I have trouble getting from my apartment to the airport? Or even allowed in? Any Portuguese residents out there that share some info?
1307,New infections in Portugal higher than in Germany when you consider # of population.
1308,"I&#39;m in Portugal and it will be after New Year.<br>NOT after Christmas...<br><br>One week in which teleworking or other forms in which contact is minimal will be mandatory, in most services."
1309,This is all well and fine but I&#39;m in US WV and over half the people refuse to vaccinate or even wear a mask yet I&#39;ve been staying home for almost 2 years now and I wish I had a Portugal so beat down
1310,Jokes on this - From &quot;Hard-hit&quot; Covid spot to fully vaccinated but still &quot;hard hit&quot; covid spot.
1311,"Well done Portugal, don&#39;t let your guard down now you&#39;re winning."
1312,Congratulations ... Portugal for keeping your people safe and healthy....<br>God Bless....
1313,"the vaccination is good, but not so unusual. what is unsual is masking...more people masking, young and old, in small towns and big cities.and none of those scarfs or bandanas, surgical masks or kn95/n95 masks. you don&#39;t see that in the uk or most other parts of europe."
1314,"From the last explanation, we may also infer that properly vaccinated humans may also carry the virus and eventually spread it to everywhere they go. A little cough or sneeze may be sufficient to spread the virus. Therefore herd immunity is so important to reach human health security and protect humanity from this deadly virus."
1315,People always seem to think or ignore that Portugal is not big deal of a country and dont think Portugal can be an example. Everyone always seem to just say or talk Portugal having good tourism and Football aka Ronaldo. Portugal deserves at times more respect and a better look. Cuz when its lets say Spain everybody talks about n its on the front Page News
1316,From drug reform to covd they have done well
1317,"Thank god i invested early on on the big 4.... the value has skyrocketed and even more with this new variant !!!! Before anyone gets mad, i&#39;m just investing on saving lifes all over the world to win this pandemic and not and never for the money as the conspiracists and negacionists like to tell 🤨"
1318,Next year we have a new variant and all starts again.
1319,That&#39;s good. New Zealand just hit 90% fully vaccinated without children counting and 95% first doses so when children can be done here it will be the high 90&#39;s for our vaccination rate
1320,"they have already announced a one week post-christmas lockdown? interesting, though I wonder if it will defeat its purpose by causing people to travel more. I would imagine that for a lot of people a pre-announced one week extended christmas holiday sounds like a perfect opportunity to travel."
1321,"It&#39;s a cycle. Hard-hit, then success story, then new variant, new wave, then hard-hit again. Repeat cycle."
1322,What about statistic of people with Long Covid issues? Do we have any figures on that?
1323,Old people in the hospital. Seems normal. Just like last year
1324,Is Covid will end in Portugal ? My answer is not because first we are living global world that interconnected than before and second there always be a threat for Portugal from outside of Portugal. As long as the other country outside Portugal is still struggle of Covid than Portugal is still have a threat from Covid. The problem for Portugal is not coming from inside but from outside for Portugal.
1325,Sometimes it takes a 2x4 to the head to convince some people.  That&#39;s all that happened with Portugal.  They learned the hard way.
1326,Portugal was way behind until a record high wave hit them and people decided to get vaccinated en masse out of fear.<br>This story is sugar coating events. Kudos to the Portuguese people for doing the right thing when in dire need.

1331,The portugese appear to be the example in Europe where they see society as a whole is more valuable than individual human freedoms.  Keep up the good work.
1332,"We love Portugal. They provide lots of testing options and recognize rapid tests as a valid option for restaurants and venues. That said, we both caught Covid there in September even though it was already nearly 90% vaccinated. Now, all entrants to the country must present a negative test."
1333,Well done Portugal. Now we wait and see if the vax really work or not.
1334,Good journalism

It doesn&#39;t matter much the effect, you just keep beating them because they will take it.<br><br>The drop which filled the glass was mass vaccination for the children, a clear non-affected category.<br><br>Meanwhile, Romania - 30% vaccinated, just entered the green zone.<br><br>World has gone crazy and it seems it can&#39;t find the way back."

1391,Wowww I have never found so many misinterpreted ideas of Portugal... So far from the truth... but then again who am I to prove you wrong... As a Portuguese I invite you to come in live in Portugal and  see it for yourselves... What one says most often is far from what one does... Welcome to the Upside World! Love Stranger Things ehehe

1393,Well... no. I don&#39;t like tyrannical mandates from governments. End of discussion. And I&#39;m way more afraid of side effects from the experimental substance than covid-19. I&#39;m 42.
1394,No. No mandates and no segregation of people based on their vaccine status either!
1395,"I think all countries would find less hesitancy if our leaders communicated the truth more often. <br><br>A great deal of the hesitancy comes from a deep seeded, well earned distrust of elected officials who, in regards to COVID-19 especially, have been communicating horribly.<br><br>This pandemic has shown clearly, how incompetent our government leaders are, and how ill prepared we were. <br><br>Pandemics are nothing new, they&#39;ve been around for millenia yet, once it began, many countries simply ignored or dismissed the WHO&#39;s announcement. <br><br>They just hoped, like they often do, that it would just blow over.

1396,"&quot;So if you still need a booster after being fully vaccinated, and testing after being fully vaccinated, and hospitalizations after fully vaccinated, and masks, social distancing &amp; and lockdowns all after being fully vaccinated?<br>Then it&#39;s time to admit you&#39;ve fully conned.&quot;- Dr. Adam Aneevit"

1401,"What good would it do if everyone were vaccinated? What is the thinking that the virus would die or stop progressing along its evolutionary trajectory? And if it’s so vital, then why aren’t poorer nations being subsidised with free vaccines as a matter of life and death? Makes me wonder"
1402,No! It shouldn&#39;t be mandatory... It&#39;s against human rights and is discriminatory
1403,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHUPEzTeJbk&amp;t=3m07s"">3:07</a> &quot;some worry&quot; why doesn&#39;t everyone? seems like a clear outcome to me. I think there is a lot of desperate focus on vaccines as a way out of the crisis while it has been shown that they alone can never be that. Forcing people to give up their right of self determination over their body because it would be &quot;nice&quot; to know everybody has been given a limited protection whose viability in stopping the pandemic is dubious just seems blinded by hysteria to me. <br><br>Instead we should maybe wear masks and adjust our behavious while letting those be vaccinated that want to be.

1406,I am curious why it was said that Austria would be the first European country to have a general vaccine mandate when it appears it would be the first in the world. Seems like they are insinuating another country has done it already which seems not to be the case.
1407,"Anything foreign to the human body is a choice period, if your one of those freaks that want to control another just think to yourself if someone were to do the same to you on any level you would feel the same way. these narcissistic psychopaths that continue these fruitless endeavors are making a whole new level of discrimination"

1410,"The question everyone should be asking is, do governments have legality anymore."
1411,I agree with Walter Ricciardi...he is not only thinking about what happens now but also about the future of humankind
1412,We need to stand up! Only we can end this!
1413,In his last explanation the percentages are skewed. We don&#39;t live in a closed off world where only vaccinated people are engaging with each other and vice versa. Keeping the percentage at 50% a of hospitalized are vaccinated is more accurate.
1414,What a one sided report! I can tell you many German nurses will be quitting and oh what you didn’t mention: Italy is in real trouble and already debating on asking the unvaccinated nurses and doctors to come back…. I am sick of this typical mainstream reporting 🤮
1415,"So Andrea, you are safer if everyone gets the vaccine? Why aren&#39;t you safe if only you have the vaccine?"

1424,"If they want to save lives, make driving school mandatory."
1425,"I guess humans rights, self determination and the nuremberg code was just for show. 😂😂"
1426,Another interesting question: why are nurses telling us that the most patients are vaccinated? And mainstream are telling us the opposite! No wonder my trust in the system is going down the drain…
1427,"Lord Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” Luke 23:34. It is apt to say here in current context that the vaccine advocacy group (viz, big pharma, big tech and social network et al) do not know what harm they are doing to their own businesses. It’s like a double edged sword. On the multifaceted side effect that are yet to surface in the vaccinated group, there will be a total loss of trust and faith on pharma drugs. On the other hand due to explosive protests and disenchantment towards forcible vaccine mandate people are going to be extremely cautious about their health and nutrition causing a huge decline in pharma business in long term. It seems due to the greed of profit the pharma business and their cohorts have lost their mind and forgot the basic principle of marketing strategy. Feel absolute pity for them. In fact this man created pandemic is a blessings in disguise for humanity."
1428,OBVIOUSLY IT SHOULD NOT BE MANDATORY.
1429,Wonder how many dislikes this has ..
1430,I take offense to the title of the video. <br>These are crimes premafacia.
1431,why? it doesnt stop the spread.
1432,"Why not tell people this virus is here to stay. Vaccine will help,but not stop a virus that is ever changing."
1433,Lol! They can “mandate” all they want it doesn’t mean anything unless all parties involved enter VOLUNTARILY. Look it up...legal definition of mandate.
1434,Keep on being obedient and end up like Australia... wake up... check not censored channels and find the truth
1435,how can you say you are making people safe if you will still catch covid and can spread it to other people even if you are fully vaccinated ???
1436,If vaccination solves the pandemic why is it not happening  now?
1437,Should news networks only be allowed one day a week to broadcast legally?<br><br>Tonight at 9
1438,How can u mandate if you  say vacinated one can also b infected. So where is govts liability  if they dont guarantee vacine prevent covid. Infection.
1439,Absolutely not!

1443,i cant believe that after 2 years of pandemic..Germany is still having trouble mandating vaccines for frontliners??? how is this happening.. like around the world asia/america are nearing 70pct full vaccination on their citizens... and Germany has not decided to have their people vaccinated.... were you sleeping this passed 2 years???

Lemon and curd ( lemon and curd are non - inflammatory things  but they act differently with different  foods, with the suggested foods they never be a cause for inflammation). <br>If someone get affected with covid 19, he must avoid lemon for some days because he already would have eaten something that lemon acts as inflammatory thing. But if the patient would have been  eating  the suggested diet very strictly for more than 18 days then he can add lemon  in his regular diet it will never be inflammatory then. The patient has to apply this diet plan very very strictly because consumption of a single fruit, dry fruit, vegetable, or non suggested grain, lentil or vegetable oil can affect the whole result. <br>Note- feed your infants with mother milk or pure animal milk,( formula  milk acts like a poison during the covid 19 infection because it contains vegetables oil.<br>(if the patient follows this diet plan strictly his body acts over covid 19 like an animal body does, he may  get affected  but  never faces the worst )..,,..,,..,,"
1454,"Also, my brain can&#39;t process the fact that there are MEDICAL WORKERS refusing to get vaccinated 🤦🏻"
1455,The mandates are the modern train ride. Don’t get on the train.
1456,"No, clearly it shouldn&#39;t be. It would be against some of the most important values democratic nations stand for, and I say it as somebody who got a booster shot today."
1457,"There is a saying like we have lies, big lies and statistics. Now I wish to add also &quot;information broadcasted by mass media&quot;. What is your opinion - where exactly it should be positioned within that saying in relation to this respective channel? It is far from reality that only vaccines and boosters will solve the issue. Mandatory vaccination is needed only to ease the situation with hospitals&#39; overload, not to save lifes..."
1458,"No, it shouldnt."
1459,Yes
1460,"No, surprised you should ask."
1461,The twisting  news...🥱🥱🥱
1462,No. Why TF is this even a question?
1463,NO!
1464,NO!
1465,Very one sided report
1466,No!
1467,"It should be evident even to basically all naysayers that two years in a pandemic have been a lot more detrimental to democracy and many societies than one more vaccine mandate. <br>I feel that we should apply &quot;I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it&quot; not only to freedom of speech - but also to our commitment to overcome the pandemic. We need to allow people to disagree, they should face no invalidation for their views, and in turn getting vaccinated should not be understood as an endorsement of a pro-mandate stance. But then, get vaccinated, and get over it."
1468,Looney&#39;s who fell for the con
1469,NO.
1470,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1471,Yoooo DW...?...... where are the flu?.... last two years no flu?..... buhahaha.....
1472,No.
1473,No.
1474,Perhaps lock down only the vaccinated for a month let the unvaccinated mingle as much as possible in a month we should have herd immunity
1475,Wrong question
1476,All mask wearers should have 50 shots a year to keep them safe😎
1477,Did somebody inform this guy about the fact that you can still spread the virus even if you’ve had the vaccine
1478,No
1479,Stuff it
1480,no
1481,"<b>When it comes to world of investing,most people don&#39;t know where to start fortunately, great investors of the past and present can provide us with guidance</b> ."
1482,"No medical intervention, medicine, vaccine or product is 100% safe and peoples&#39; right to bodily autonomy should not be subject to blackmail. Therefore the answer is no. Let those who want it, have it"
1483,NO. its against most of european countries constitutions. And especially discrimination of people based on such a thing. Plus not all vaccines available in the world are approved in EU. So its discrimination after discrimination
1484,No
1485,More BS!
1486,Wake up People...
1487,"Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Him. There is no other intermediary. May Jesus Bless you, trust Him, give your life - and He will take care of it. Christ&#39;s Coming Is Near. Don&#39;t wait, come back while you still have time"
1488,YES!
1489,"I&#39;m absolutely positive the 4th shot will solve everything. If not, then certainly the 5th and 6th will. <br><br>But, I swear, if the 7th shot doesn&#39;t finally get us back to normal then I&#39;m definitely going to reconsider getting my 8th."
1490,Not it should not<br><br>Who is responsible if for instance a previously healthy 16 year old is suffering from myocarditis after the vaccine and has actually lasting damage? Currently you have to sign agreement forms. Can they now sue the government for making it mandatory? Arent we degrading the human who is taking it to a means to an end if we accept it as collateral damage? I know it is a rare complication but it can still happen.
1491,Not to mention that 7 Germans have come back of their holiday with omicron and they where fully vaccinated with boosters !! Let’s talk about that!!
1492,"As always, we&#39;d love to include your questions in our upcoming shows! What would you like to know about the coronavirus pandemic? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23askderrick"">#askDerrick</a>"
1493,Patenting a drug developed with public money is beyond criminal.
1494,"This pandemic has opened African and poor nation&#39;s eyes!!!! AFRICA has their scientists children around the world,bring them back instead of enriching those nations that are refusing to share!!! Blessings in sufferings."
1495,"South Africa used to make nearly all its vaccines, because of boycotts. Being a pariah nation was not without some advantages."
1496,I hope Afrigen does make it.
1497,Vaccine production should remain a public good and not privatized and this issue would never ever surface! This is like how the fire department used to be privatized service. People who did not pay would not be saved from a fire which caused more problems from spillover effects and therefore it became a public service! It should be the same for vaccines!
1498,Afrigen …… it’s about time Africa rises up ✊🏿
1499,I&#39;m sure they can do it. They have the capacity.
1500,india and south africa have been calling waivers for over a year now...
1501,Thank you Africa!
1502,"Good move, well done. <br><br>But we need to have plenty of irons in the fire, so need to also make progress on local development of viral vector vaccines as well as traditional vaccines including attenuated live virus and conjugate covalent vaccines that have proven highly cost effective in the past."
1503,"Africa is massive, Nigeria and Kenya must create more vaccines too. That way African people will never be left behind on vaccines by the rich countries."
1504,"All jabs should be patent free, the polio jab was patent free. I believe all healthcare should be public knowledge"
1505,"Rather than protesting lockdowns, people in Europe should be protesting about the grave injustice of Pfzier and other big pharma flat out refusing to do what is possible to save lives and end the pandemic."
1506,My prayers are with you .
1507,"I&#39;m still in awe, that vaccines are not patient free. This is why Europe is going through wave after wave. If the whole world was vaccinated there would be a less likely chance of the virus mutating. Good Job South Africa."
1508,Let’s hope they can do this quickly
1509,Patents do not encourage innovation that has been proven over and over again. The only reason France has an aerospace industry of world wide commercial significants is because the wright brothers in their companies were busy pursuing patent action against each other instead of aerospace innovation. The French caught up and even surpassed.
1510,I&#39;m still pissed that the patents weren&#39;t waved for the duration of the pandemic. &gt;:-(
1511,Africa rising...
1512,South Africans can do it we can ho know better than the west
1513,Capitalism during a pandemic. Kudos to all the big pharma companies not standing up to share their technology
1514,I can see this encouraging pharmaceutical companies to spend billions on developing new treatments. /s.
1515,Afrigen... Fantastic!<br>That cuts it.
1516,That sounds suspiciously like leadership something the world seems to studiously avoid
1517,"The pariah nation of South Africa paving the way. Come on Nigeria, Kenya etc. What are you doing?"
1518,Better if they paved the way for decent meals for all...
1519,Scary news.  Africa is gone if this mRNA is in play

1525,Looks like she is asking for intellectual property and not committing to giving away for free what they developed- if I were moderna- no deal
1526,thumbs up<br>the story<br>not DW reporting
1527,Patents encourage innovation? I don&#39;t buy that
1528,South Africa has definitely paved the way to relay on natural immunity.
1529,Hopefully
1530,What a scam
1531,"Real price of making 1 dose of Covid19 vaccine is <del>guess</del> just $1,42!<br>But since wealthy countries  can pay much more and hoard vaccines, the price jumps to over $20/ dose.<br>Africa does not have so much money to pay such a exorbitant <br>price, hence only a small percentage of population is jabbed.<br>Not to mention about logistics of delivering jabs  to ppl living in remote  areas. <br>Money rules"
1532,sorry ရောဂါအကြောင်းအကုန်<br>ပိတ်တယ်မနေ့ကရေးတင်တယ်<br>ပယ်ချတယ်
1533,Saline solution
1534,"so  that is why there is a new variant  now, so the drug company can make money, it makes sense now,   follow the money   if this statement is  unfalse proven it"

1540,"India&#39;s overall vaccination rate is pretty good comparing that to countries that are even 1/5 the size of India.The attitude towards vaccination and the spreading of right information about the importance of vaccine has been also pretty good.But u are gonna face challenges when u are gonna fully vaccinate 1.38 billion people on a voluntary basis,with no official compulsion on taking vaccines yet.Let&#39;s hope for the best that everyone could get fully vaccinated soon."
1541,Arunachal Pradesh is integrated part of India....ther is no doubt....
1542,"Politics also plays a key role, like in Himachal Pradesh 100% fully vaccinated, because politicians have been quiet honest, imparted education to people"
1543,"I love how everytime a western media shows India or reports on India, they always present this picture of a poor nation while conveniently forgetting the state of poverty in the countries they broadcast from. I also love how DW conveniently forgot the fact over 55% of Indians are now fully vaccinated which represents almost 80% of EU numbers and EU is nowhere close to getting their vaccines to due local vaccine hesitancy. I understand the need to report on the wave but the journalism being done in this report is absolutely shambolic."
1544,All the best to India. Given the size and the incredible number of ppl living in that country Indians did do pretty well. So far India is still standing. Hope you will be victorious.
1545,Indias vaccine rate is good .. As it’s population is huge .. it will take some time .. but it has done good job in reaching out to people ..
1546,"They are called ASHA workers. They have basic medical training and are the Frontline public health workers of India. They are extremely hard working people and some of them face enormous stigma from their own community. Sadly, India&#39;s decades of neglect of healthcare means they are paid pittance for the amount of work they do."
1547,"In India, the second vaccine dose is usually the natural infection, since the Alpha and Delta variants spread through almost the entire population."
1548,India&#39;s positive results with the alternative therapeutics saw one of its most populated states become virtually covid case free. <br>They achieved this even with delta.<br>They are prepared.
1549,"Sucks that these things comes and goes in waves. Even when we think we&#39;re done, we&#39;re not. It&#39;s coming again."
1550,"With Omicron being EXTREMELY MILD it could well be India&#39;s salvation, by safely bringing this pandemic to an end without poorly tested vaccines."
1551,Don&#39;t show India&#39;s map in your news...you don&#39;t have courage to show it rightly
1552,Also DW do more programs to try &amp; convince your German citizens (I believe more than a third of them) to get atleast their first jab
1553,Also make a video on &quot;Is Germany prepared for the next flood?&quot;
1554,"Ask the ngos how many died during the second wave. Dr Rajib put it in a nutshell, namely the question of natural exposure and hence added immunity after a single dose. Actually over 90% of India has had the equivalent of a double vaccination. This surpasses Germany by far !"
1555,I believed we have achieved herd immunity either with vaccine or infection.
1556,I knew it…..DW’s plane landed on a village…just like ever other media…thank god they didn’t played that stereotypical background music…
1557,"I can just imagine the household conversations in that village, &quot;husband when are you going to get vaccinated that annoying nurse is coming again and not so keen on you talking to her every week&quot;. The nurse is great she would cause me to get vaccinated if I was hesitant, sort of like some scary nurse in some old movie."
1558,"In India, 69% are adults, while 31% are children, herd immunity can be achieved by 75%, and vaccine for children will be after more 6 months from December 2021. How will India do that?<br>The report should be on this?"
1559,"Say what you like, we are depending on GOD’s grace to put ourselves through this covid situation, it’s not science or any human efforts, just the grace of GOD."
1560,For your kind information DW news India reported its lowest covid positive tally yesterday.

1575,VACCINE INEQUITY <br>Rich western nation&#39;s vaccine hoarding behavior and banning of mRNA vaccine patent waivers has created this omicron.
1576,Hurry up make next goal of fully vaccination of people not later than 15th January
1577,Germany has India&#39;s 1/15th of population and a far better health facility. <br>Why the are not able to vaccinat the entire population
1578,"Why you always say or show negetive side of india which is fewer , please stop this 🙏"
1579,Seriously?<br>Do you know the population of India and that of other countries<br>And still they are not Fully vaccinated after having less than our population
1580,So controversial area was in light Grey? Smart move for DW
1581,But deaths cases now are highest in Europe see the per capita report
1582,55% got the second shots already
1583,I want to go next Diwali (October 2022). If they stick to their current rate of vaccination they&#39;ll double jab 80% by April 2022 or 85% by May 2022 so 5-6 more months to give 3rd jab / boosters.
1584,Report this video and report DW news to the government for showing wrong map of India.
1585,Why is there is a push when it is well known that jabs are not working neither stop infections and not stop infections.  It would be better to have early treatments
1586,i watching  your news in kerala (india)
1587,"DW need to spend more time &amp; resources to help vaccinate Germans, instead llof trying to find fault with India, where everything is in control &amp; vaccinations being done at an incredibly fast pace"

1590,This is crazy. Why must I come back for the second dose if I died after the first dose?
1591,"Please stop this nonsense. Present the big picture that is happening in India, with proper visuals. What kind of degraded visuals u are showing from a small village? <br>Many people around the world think India looks only the way you show here. You never showed the bright side of India&#39;s development."

1617,Close school🏫 and cancel exam ❌
1618,low? seriously? have you tried vaccinating a billion people?
1619,India made the best vaccine
1620,I always disagree with DW news when they are biased on the religious issues or the kashmir issue in india and other stuff but this is accurate news especially in the rural areas where the vaccination rate is really low and looking at how poeple are roaming freely without masks attending weddings etc. Looking at all this I really feel another wave in india is inevitable for sure.

1647,"the party that appears in this video is for poor children. and it was only carried out because the cases and deaths are very low. more every day we watch the newspaper on tv and we are informed if the cases have increased. we in Brazil do not live in the world of alice in wonderland. we are still very concerned about the new covid variations . we continue to use masks because they have always been mandatory here . Crowd is still frowned upon here , and when you have a party at a celebrity &#39;s house , the guests are tested . people are only calmer because the percentage of deaths and infections is very low. but we are careful if it increases here. our thermometer (to find out if it&#39;s getting worse) is the TV and internet newspaper, twitter....we are informed every day with the news of any possible new virus."
1648,"Too early to celebrate. Be careful, Brazil!"
1649,Too early to celebrate. The summer in Brazil and early immunity with vaccines could be a reason for the drop in numbers. This phenomenon was seen in other parts of the world including the USA.

The political issue next year in elections may also contribute to a change of scenario, as the current president does not even wear a mask or support vaccination.  Now there is concern about the cases of Flu in Rio de Janeiro, in short, vaccination and precautions are still the best scenario.  P.S. I&#39;m from Brazil."
1667,That should  bring joy to big pharma and their stock holders .
1668,"Simple. No ouchy, no booty."
1669,Natalia Pasternak rocks!!!
1670,95% vaccinated in over 16 year olds where I am in Australia.

1674,🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
1675,"Why are you showing stock recordings from Toulouse, France in a segment about Covid in Brazil?"
1676,All those poor sheep...
1677,Great
1678,Correction: over 75 percent had at least gotten the first shot. 65 percent are fully immunized. But I still wear mask outdoor and avoid crowd. IMO too early to celebrate. Stay healty folk.
1679,Único brasileiro dos comentários. Ou é impressão minha?
1680,Say hello to after the celebrations !
1681,Have fun with it
1682,YouTube censorship is just ridiculous right now.
1683,Brazilian knows how to party...we made it...let&#39;s party..
1684,Brazil has fallen behind Thailand.<br>Perhaps Indonesia will surpass him next year.
1685,My theory is most of the weakeet ones have already dead 😅
1686,covid: So?
1687,just let them enjoy their moments and become the india 2.0
1688,Seeing that in Brazil there are scientists like Dra Natália makes me feel very proud to be Brazilian!
1689,Congrats Brazil for not letting your hospitals from going out of control without excessive force on restrictions.
1690,All thanks to Bolsonaro
1691,Bolsonaro 2022
1692,"Just get rid of your president as well, Brazil! ❤️"
1693,now is 90%
1694,Toxoplasmosis?
1695,One person dies from omicron varriant in the UK says Boris Johnson 😭 huge outbreak of Omicron variant in London 😭
1696,"Covid: &quot;Not too fast Brazil, have two more guests arriving for the holidays. Meet Omicron and &quot;stealth&quot; Omicron. They will be staying for a while.&quot;"
1697,Nice .. that ture .. but I don&#39;t known why I don&#39;t belive the government..the politicians..
1698,☝️ thanks for always being a reliable source to trust on word are not enough to express how grateful I am
1699,The hope for Brazil is Lula 2022<br>Lula ❤️🇧🇷
1700,It&#39;s too early. 75% is still too low for omicron. But I think it won&#39;t be as worse as other  countries with higher antivax percentiles.
1701,"Hey guys. Here in France, we have 90% of adults vaccinated and it does not solve the problem, for your information ^_^."
1702,Don&#39;t celebrate to early. Wait why even celebrating? Hundred of thousands die. Until there are still people who getting hospitalized and dying because of the virus. This is not over. I just hope that won&#39;t spread
1703,This is wonderful
1704,It’s to soon to believe this.   Why don’t we come back in 5 or 10 years and see what happened.
1705,Omicron is laughing about it. New version will be released soon.......
1706,🤥!
1707,Sponsored by TikTok? Jesss.....
1708,"José is with J not H, don&#39;t mix with spanish"
1709,Watch Omicron take over there
1710,Lets wait and see  2021 is not over. See  Israel
1711,What a bunch of saps!
1712,75% intoxicated good news for the pharma
1713,Anti-vaxxers: What proof do you have that vaccinations do anything<br>Brazil:-gestures to empty hospital beds-
1714,"75% lmao, yea... sure...."
1715,Omicron sounds like a transformer
1716,This is fantastic. ...bolsonaro initiated this program?
1717,Incredible Brasil show EU &amp; US countries how the people should teact and vaccinate that it. Then noobligation no pass ect… Bravo Brasil and Brasillan !!
1718,"Stop terrorising people. I have dozens of fellows in Brazil, devide your terror by at least 50.   DW! You are spoiling years of your beautiful history. Stay in the side of the people (coffins have no pockets). God Bless You All (All) !"
1719,"USA, wake up and see what Brazil is doing? Put your politics aside!"
1720,"Not so far fast Brazil, says Omicron."
1721,"We could be even in a better situation if our President, Mr. Bolsonaro didn&#39;t mess up the vaccination process. We are not that monster. Me, as a Brazilian have this mixed feeling about everything in my country."
1722,"FINALLY!! About time, Brazil. You finally woke up."
1723,One of the leaders of the developing world. Thanks Bolsonaro
1724,Brazil has the second highest death number in the world but if consider the size of population Brasil is in 11° place.
1725,Quem ousa convocar nos brasileiros?<br><br>Se tem Brazil no título vai ter brasileiros aq
1726,Philippines COVID cases now is only 300+ a day because so many has been vaccinated almost 90M people vaccinated for a population of 110M. National capital region is 95% fully vaccinated that&#39;s why we only have less than 100 cases a day. Most COVID wards in the hospitals are now closed. Some doesn&#39;t have COVID admission. Indeed vaccines work.
1727,"As always, we&#39;d love to include your questions in our upcoming shows! What would you like to know about the coronavirus pandemic? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23askderrick"">#askDerrick</a>"
1728,"This woman is phenomenal at translating the scientific conclusions into language that is understandable for viewers, but not oversimplifying to the point of distortion or becoming jovial or patronizing. Illustrating the underlying concepts and principles at work. Emma Hodcroft! Talented science communicator!"
1729,"I thank South African Researchers and doctors for their focus on the need to test, break down and alert the rest of the world about this new variant."
1730,"After the South African revelation of the new variant, suddenly dutch scientists retrospectively unveiled their findings from October 2021in which they found first signs of Omicron. Such a level of transparency in the Netherlands, a country that doesn’t seem to learn from its own mistakes, over and over, again and again. Bless those scientists in South Africa. Very good reporting."
1731,Dr. Ms. Hodcroft is excellent at explaining things related to covid to us. Thank you to all the scientists for working so hard for the world!
1732,"Why is it when the speaker is so objective and scientific, it is so pleasant to listen to even if the news is about a virus? Even the news anchor is so professional just letting her speak and questions are so objective as well."
1733,The 1918 &#39;Spanish Flu&#39; warning was first announced by Spain. It didn&#39;t come from Spain. Spain chose to act responsibly.
1734,"Even though a lot of people may get it at the same time, it&#39;s looking like a very mild form, it may be an excellent vaccine in itself slowing delta down. Mutation is directly related to prevalence, so with that many getting it all at once, it may mutate again soon... We might get lucky though and it may be the beginning of the end for Covid. I doubt we can have tailored vaccines in time for something this infectious."
1735,By far the best and most comprehensive report on the Omicron variant that I have seen or heard. Thankyou.
1736,"This guest expert, Dr./Ms. Hodcroft is excellent, a really good communicator.  That’s one thing I like about DW, the high quality of the experts it features."
1737,"I can tell you this, I got Omicron I was down for three days and 7 days later I am still dealing with stuff in my lungs.  I do take meds that suppresses my immune system and I am not vaccinated.  I got it from my son (18 years old) he bounced back pretty quick."
1738,"Derrick, is that out of concern related to theory of original antigenic sin? Can we conclude from Emma’s fantastic explainer that this virus is heading more towards divergent evolution with Omicron? Very grateful for these detailed updates!"
1739,"Excellent presentation and interview! Well done. Go Emma!  A few added points. Omicron is spreading extremely fast despite vaccinations and controls. In Gauteng it has an Rt of 5.5. That is huge. In the center of the cases in UK and Denmark the initial growth has an Rt of 9-10, though that seems to be slowing to ~5. This has several impacts. The growth in new cases is explosive. There is as Emma said a long delay of about two weeks from infection to hospitalization. Because of this case numbers rise rapidly with little evidence of seriousness for another week or two from hospitalizations and deaths. Both of those are now rising right on schedule following the same rise expected. In other words, this is not a “mild” variant. However, as this is spreading so fast globally and right over the Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanza, Yule, Winter Solstice, New Years holidays people are traveling the most, and monitoring and reporting are lowest. This sets the stage for a bomb like explosion in cases. By the time case numbers are significant, the actual number of infected people will be substantially higher - approximately 25 times higher. Any actions taken will not prevent those already infected from getting sick. And it will take time for people to be convinced and to respond. That will result in the case numbers being up to 10 times higher yet before those actions slow or stop the case rate growth. By then the number of cases per day will have risen by 250 times what they were when the call to take action was made. Even if that decision is made when the case rate is at a level that is only 10% of the level that overwhelms hospitals, in a week or so they will be overwhelmed. But the rate of cases will continue to rise dramatically. Decisions to act at this sort of art must come very early if that is to be avoided. Even if the Rt is reduced to 3, the conditions will still overwhelm hospitals and carers."
1740,"The average life expectancy in South Africa is only 67. Omicron might be a very different problem when elderly or overweight westerners start getting it. It also might very be very mild, in which case it could be the end of it."
1741,"I&#39;m no virologist, but the best ones I follow are showing genuine optimism regarding Omicron. Yes, the data is preliminary from S. Africa, but conclusive enough to extrapolate that the new variant will almost certainly result in the end of the Pandemic as we know it. The transmissibility is extraordinary, but the symptoms are more similar to having a bad cold and short-lived. Therefore, the probable scenario is over the enxt few moths most become infected, develop natural immunity and then the world reaches herd immunity....the virus virtually ends itself. I have invested accordingly- buy cruise line stocks, e.g. Good luck and good health to all."
1742,"love ur &quot;no BS&quot; coverage, thanks:)"
1743,"Simply brilliant reporting. Accurate, unbiased, unsensationalized, and well-informed journalism. Well done DW!"
1744,I think that this is so interesting. Back when the Spanish flue was around we could not pick up all the variants but now that we can I think that this is our autoimmune response to breaking down the virus to a point where it becomes of less concern. Just my unqualified understanding. Let&#39;s wait and see what happens over time.
1745,Those two scientists explain so clearly and understandable I could listened to them for hours.
1746,Props to scientists from South Africa. Thank you for doing important work.
1747,Thank you for correcting your previous statements of it starting in Sub-Saharan Africa... unfortunately the damage is done to our economies... Journalists need to start moving back to high integrity and NOT sensationalism...
1748,"Good report. Will be interested to learn what % of people who get Omicron become long haul patients. The long haul impact of Covid is going to destroy our incredibly bad sick care system here in America. In America, that will probably be the best thing that comes out of this tragic pandemic."
1749,Thankyou South Africa for telling the world
1750,"We know in my area in Ontario it has been circulating longer than we thought, even before the &quot;first two&quot; cases were reported. The horse is out of the stable and it is probably a good thing."
1751,"If Omicron can indeed circumvent vaccine and previous infection protection, what makes you all think that getting Omicron means that you’ll be immune to Delta?"
1752,Best question and explanations on Omicron.. 👍
1753,"You can catch even pre omicron versions while vaccinated and spread it. Not only, but especially after the vaccine effficacy declines, which with some vaccines is 2 months (j&amp;j) and with some six months. Important to realize for todays discourse"
1754,"&quot;Omicron variant could act as a natural vaccine in the unvaccinated”- Prof. Eleanor Riley, immunology and infectious diseases, University of Edinburgh"
1755,"I&#39;m from SA and currently infected with omicron, and the symptoms are much milder than the Beta variant which i previously was infected with that sent me to the hospital for 9 days. That was last year. I am not vaccinated."
1756,Thank u for the coverage and info
1757,Does the Omicron variant still binds exclusively to ACE2 receptor or could it potentially use another &quot;gateway&quot;?
1758,"The reaction from numerous countries&#39; politicians is rather perplexing to me with regards to banning travel. Medical observations show a mild response with 3 days of discomfort. The natural immunity created by this variant is of great benefit to mankind so trying to stop it over the Delta variant seems counterproductive to progress. And no additional vaccines for a new variant would be thus required in the end. But then, what do I know about such things....."
1759,"It may be mild now (but I recall people were saying delta was milder in the early days too) but I have a feeling that as the virus multiples in a population and the circulating viruses in the environment increases, people will start become infected with higher starting titers of virus--then they&#39;ll tend to get sicker--how much it&#39;s hard to say (since it&#39;s so infective, chances are most people who test positive currently were infected with only the most trace amounts of virus, and mild symptoms). Perhaps you might as well be better off catching it now when the it&#39;s early days..."
1760,This is the best video of watched regarding omicron. It lacks the fear-mongering that most of these news sites are playing into.
1761,only 10% of patients in hospital require oxzgen. it was 100% of patients with the delta varient. also much lower hospitalisation rate. Omicron might just end this pandemic?
1762,"Omicron, if less deadly, could be the only hope to get out of this mess, scientists surely don&#39;t have a solution for now."
1763,Infections are spreading faster in the UK than in South Africa. Are flights from UK going to be banned? Why not?
1764,Is it possible that someone been infected by both Delta &amp; Omicron? What will that do to the respected viruses? More mutation? 🤦🏻‍♂️
1765,"Your voiceover seem to have made a common mistake. Almost immediately he said, &quot;that means that even vaccinated people can become infected.&quot; That&#39;s because it&#39;s a vaccine and not a cure. You can always become infected if you have a vaccine but it&#39;s less likely that you will be severely affected by the virus, because you body has learnt how to fight it (in this case, attacking certain proteins on the outside of the virus). Whereas, if it was a cure (which it isn&#39;t), you would still be able to become infected, but it would save your life once the cure is administered to you, since a cure is only administered after you&#39;re already affected by something. There&#39;s a very big difference between a vaccine and a cure. One is preventative (vaccine) and the latter is reactive (to reverse the affects and save you). Please don&#39;t confuse the two. I&#39;ve seen to many ignorant &quot;influencers&quot; sharing misinformation on social media arguing that &quot;vaccines don&#39;t work&quot; because they know people how have still contracted Covid even after having the vaccine. That&#39;s because it&#39;s not a cure... It might have saved their lives though."
1766,Why we are ignoring information from Africa experts where the Omicron was discovered that are claiming that it is very mild and we are  acting like they would be saying something much differed?
1767,Dr John Campbell is THE most thorough  researcher on these viruses.   He can be found regularly on YouTube   He’s on the station this evening.  Well worth listening to him...  top class stuff.  And so easy to understand too.
1768,"DW has turned into an official COVID representative, it&#39;s always COVID news in this channel."
1769,"If omicron is indeed far less severe, should we actually encourage the spread? I read an article that suggested the pandemic would be over if we didn&#39;t do mitigation. It is likely that without mitigation, more people would have died from Covid but think about all the economic and social destruction the Trump lockdowns caused. I&#39;m not saying either way, just thinking out loud."
1770,Thanks for almost 12 minutes of quality info. 🥰
1771,"It’s no longer called Coronavirus, but now it’s called Omicron."
1772,I love how they talk about this viruses’ variants’ parents and grandparents.
1773,"I believe that the more viruses mutate, the more transmissible it gets, and at the same time the weaker it becomes. I hope that the Omicron variant is the tipping point for sars-covid2 when it finally becomes a mild form of the disease."
1774,Such an intelligent lady. We are so lucky so many intelligent people are that good and hard working.
1775,How do new variant wipe out old variants ?
1776,"A new study published on the preprint server bioRxiv* assesses the antiviral activity of stenoparib against four severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs). This study also focuses on the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant by a combination of stenoparib and remdesivir.<br>The researchers of the current study also evaluated the inhibitory action of a combination of stenoparib and remdesivir against the Alpha variant. Vero E6 cells were infected with the Alpha variant, which was followed by an assessment of the activity of stenoparib using the plaque reduction assay. Plaques are areas of dead or destroyed cells that appear as small, clear regions in an infected cell monolayer after staining.<br>For the analysis, lower doses of stenoparib were combined with the previously reported 50% effective concentration (EC50) of remdesivir. Neither stenoparib nor remdesivir achieved greater than a 50% reduction in plaquing efficiency compared to the infected, untreated cells.<br>When combined, the drugs acted synergistically and plaque inhibition increased to over 90%. This activity was superior to what was achieved with either drug alone. Notably, this combination did not cause significant cytotoxicity.<br>Since both remdesivir and stenoparib have two different mechanisms of action, the combined effect of these drugs appears to be synergistic. This provides the potential benefit of minimizing undesirable side effects by reducing individual doses of each drug.<br>Stenoparib effectively inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type and variant strains in vitro. A host-targeting drug like stenoparib may be beneficial for COVID-19 patients as a standalone therapy, or in combination with an antiviral drug such as remdesivir or molnupiravir.<br>Remdesivir and molnupiravir are known to inhibit the viral replicon, whereas stenoparib most likely acts through multiple targets. The current study provides a proof of concept that a combination of stenoparib and remdesivir or molnupiravir may be potent at inhibiting SARS-family coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2"
1777,Or Omicron has been heavily modified and that&#39;s why it doesn&#39;t have near relatives.
1778,"Expect more variants coming like the cold virus.  No cure just fear, division, control and mandates."
1779,That scientist really knows her stuff.
1780,"They discovered it a couple of weeks ago, it could have been around for months- and since it is milder than delta, no one took their sniffles as a SARS- CoV- 2 mutation."
1781,"I could be wrong but I&#39;m pretty sure my generation won&#39;t see an end to this COVID-19 thing. At best, the pandemic could be up and down, but never off the table. We simply can&#39;t keep vaccinating the world every year, and hope people follow the prevention measures."
1782,"Not against the country, against new unknown variant"
1783,I swear if we get a second pandemic I WILL DIE
1784,In South Africa the deaths rate from Omicron 10 falls lower than from Delta.
1785,"Surely higher transmission equals a higher chance of potential mutations of varients of concern or variants of high consequence? This is a big worry for the future. How can we possibly keep on top of this using the boosters? 🤔 I think I may stock up on the vit D, K and zink even more now. Geezers!"
1786,Why the severity of Delta variant was faster determined than the omicron variant?
1787,Question is how this omicron spreads to the world if we need the PCR tests to fly? Something is not right isn&#39;t ?
1788,"It is too early for now the surge of omicron, the expectancy for now is about few months revelation will come out, so we better get prepared maybe if the still stubborn."
1789,No panic the virus is changing into something more manageable it&#39;s all good
1790,Has there been even one person who developed pneumonia from Omicron and has died??? Like in the whole world? Even one case??
1791,"Let us hear of this new one, 👍 it cannot all be spread off from coldness, because of our hot countries so it is a mutacious surely"
1792,"Thank you for information, nice lead!"
1793,"We also know that somehow,yet unsurprisingly, the Vaccine companies already know they need to make another special vaccine for it, while Virologists have said if it&#39;s less severe, Vaccines are less important."
1794,We are all going to &quot; Live &quot; online lifes and roll around in  bubbles when we actually want to be in contact with real life human beings. 2019 I miss you😣
1795,"I was all for masks, and 2 vaccines. Now my family and i feel hesitant about boosters and now an Omnicron vaccine in March? How much is TOO much?"
1796,"well, i remember - even more so, as it was quite recently - that in the beginning, when the &quot;omicron&quot; appeared, it was said to be from botswana. if it is indeed very contagious, much more than the rest - since the inadequate m rn a v@x&quot; only protects against one single spike which has mutated 32 times now.... 😂 - then, i bet, it is indeed already wide spread, so.... probably much, much more milder symptoms. so... idk, scaremongering does not really work, i mean this is not ebola, not tb, not small pox, not the plague..."
1797,"The pushback against travel bans is nonsensical. The conclusion would be no one should have enacted travel bans at the beginning of the pandemic either, so just wait for it to get into your country unabated. Australia, Taiwan, Vietnam, and New Zealand would like to have a word with you about that."
1798,"How come they don’t name it Omnivariant 2021. Due to year. ? While yes its origins is SarsCov2- but its a new edition. Quite frankly, I do not think this is ever- going away in our lifetimes."
1799,Omicron is identical to a gain of function sars cov 2 variant developed in a lab in June of 2020.
1800,Reports show that the virus variant Omicron b.1.1.529 discovered in November 2021 in Botswana and SA and now at 90% IS the entire caseload in South Africa. So more cases less sick. Yet again I keep hearing about vaccinated people having symptoms.  What about the unvaccinated?
1801,Fascinating that the DW journalists and the interviewed virologists have not got the insight of the commentators
1802,Two years ! Two years! When will this end.
1803,"This story contains a lot of mights, shoulds, and coulds."
1804,Can a person be infected with Delta and Omicron at the same time?
1805,"Is it possible to be infected by both Delta and Omicron variants simultaneously? If so, what might the clinical conditions be?"
1806,i ask myself if its super healthy to get in short period of time a lot of vaccines and boosters and this over the next 2-3-4 years .... can this not overload the body and generate a (Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) similar like the body gets overloaded on sugar and get insulin tolerance ... or same with alcahol tolerance. i mean i am vaccinated 2x but to get boosters and more and more of them in the upcomming months .... i think will generate a negativ effect on the humans immun system i am not a sientist but i have some serious questions about this practice on the long run. i seriously doubt you can endlessly boost immunity. it will have an effect like anythink else you take in overdoses. i would really have a serious discussion with some experts and feel them down to the teeth.
1807,So what did we learn? <br><br>1. Travel ban bad.<br>2. We don&#39;t know a lot about the virus<br>3. Vaccine producing companies can tweak their Vaccine to more effectively target the new variant if needed. <br><br>Saved you a lot of time. Let me know if I missed anything.
1808,"What I don&#39;t understand is why a virus &quot;overtakes&quot; other viruses.<br><br>Let&#39;s say all russians decide to do a diaspora. Russians all over the world.<br><br>French, Nigerians, Chinese, Brasilians wouldn&#39;t dissapear from their native country. Anyone can explain?"
1809,"Travel bans and quarantines DO work. The problem is that when Omicron was announced to the world it had already escaped and been detected in Hong Kong, an international flight hub, yet travel bans were only laid on Africa. This time authorities didn&#39;t even bother to properly try to keep the virus contained."
1810,How many people have died or been hospitalised from this new strain?
1811,The idea that Omikron was already here and not in an animal should be better explained.
1812,"My question is, Will the Omicron varient still be around when the new vaccine is ready???"
1813,She very carefully skipped the most likely source of omicrons lack of evolution... The fact it was in a labs fridge.
1814,"Emma Hodcroft is one of the few people I&#39;ve heard give the correct answer on severity: way, way too early to make a judgement about severity, and that if it is similar deadliness, the speed at which it spreads and the fact that vaccines may have limited efficacy is a serious concern."
1815,Boosters tailored to variants? Sounds similar to the flu shot.
1816,"I&#39;m very glad the anchor here asked if omicron is actually a better strain to face than delta. thats an important question! however, i&#39;d be asking more specific questions. Like: how many people with omicron are on ventilators, if any?"
1817,‘Boosters tailored specifically to variants”  ….. so pretty much we will be dossing up like every variant
1818,i have a question. is there anyone of your generation who can answer a question without beginning with &#39;so&#39;?
1819,"Thank you DW for educating and repeating what we need to do to win fight against Covid - vaccinate, get jibs and boosters and wear the fricken masks!!! Follow this rules and WE WILL WIN!"
1820,It pisses me off that you can see they both are reading what to say and most people just take all this like a champ
1821,"I&#39;m far from crazy conspriracies but I do believe it wasn&#39;t a coincidence to have a institute of virology lab just right next to the place where Corona started spreading. So yes, I do believe it&#39;s manufactured and it left from them by accident. Now would it be even crazier theory to think they might designed a less severe and more contactive version of it to have the problem fixed? Some late night thoughts..."
1822,"First interview seemed very scripted. No erms or ahs. No thinking, just straight talking."
1823,"Breakthrough infections is no new news, it was already happening with the Delta variant across the world in the double jabbed so I don&#39;t know what this scaremongering is all about. I&#39;ve had my 2 jabs and will get the 3rd when offered one but I&#39;m not gonna stop my life in the meantime."
1824,Most of the whitetail deer population in North America is infected with covid-19. 30 to 50 million deer if you include Canada. They are the number one most abundant large wild animal from Canada to the United States America
1825,"The world has to thank S. Africa for discovering Omicron variant and let the world know quickly. However, I understand that other countries have to institute travel ban for now until the situation is more apparent."
1826,"Was ok report until the middle and then she went off the rails into the typical omg, it&#39;s so scary. Lost her scientific viewpoint and into speculation"
1827,"As always, we&#39;d love to include your questions in our upcoming shows! What would you like to know about the coronavirus pandemic? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23askderrick"">#askDerrick</a>"
1828,"DW stop saying Africa. But name those countries. Not all African countries have the gender gap when it comes to vaccines. Stop grouping us like we are one big country. We are not. We are not even related. Some nations are tired of this grouping. It&#39;s degrading because nations doing well are placed, at the same level as those failing"
1829,"Education and birth control are key to reducing poverty and hunger.<br>Lack of education opportunities for women and girls hurts their economic security. <br>Too many people are selfish and self centered. They do not care about anyone but themselves.<br>Seems like parents and teachers stopped teaching children the  &quot;Golden Rule&quot; 30 or 40 years ago.<br>We need to be kind to each other and take care of each other. Treat each other with kindness and respect. Protect yourself, your family and your community. Get vaccinated.  Be kind to people and animals. Do your part to reduce the impact of Climate Change. There is way too much violence in the world. Greed and selfishness are all too common. Parents and teachers are setting an example for children to follow. Too often this is a poor example of how to treat others."
1830,"DW, will you please look into tracking if the Delta variant’s severity starts to increase? <br><br>The reason is, if Omicron is only being initially detected in hospitals when Covid Tests comes back “inconclusive” for Delta.  It is likely that positive cases for Delta ALSO have a likelihood for those infected to be carrying the Omicron variant as well? <br><br>If so, it would skew the Omicron data as those hospitalizations/deaths would be counted under Delta.<br><br>I would be keeping an eye out to see if the average percentage of hospitalizations and deaths in Delta start to rise. If so, this is likely the case."
1831,"&quot;We&#39;re never gonna learn about how safe the vaccine is until we start <br>giving it,&quot; said Eric Rubin. &quot;That&#39;s just the way it goes.&quot; Coming out <br>of the mouth of an FDA Official."
1832,There are 500 million doses looking for takers in India at the SII.  They are cutting vaccine production.   What is wrong with us?
1833,"I&#39;m not sure if the condition in Africa is the same as my country. But my country also has the same problem, the women are getting covid more than men. <br>Not because of the gender inequality, but because women are most likely to work in the market while men are work in the field. <br>Though some may say it is still can be categorized as gender inequality, we have our own role to fullfil. <br>It may not lived up to the western standart, but it is what it is. my country cannot keep up with the standart that western society."
1834,"Even if they believe the conspiracy theories, I can’t imagine how some women would prefer to get COVID (or any disease for that matter), than become infertile ? Is the underlying reason for the gender vaccine gap due to women choosing not to get vaxxed OR is it the men who are discouraging them ? (Because their obsession to have sons, outweighs their concern for women’s lives ?)"
1835,Imagine if they put the same focus on racial inequalities in wealth distribution. Hypocrites
1836,"China and India must be considered rich countries?( Fully Vaccinated :  China 1.1 billion, India 492 Million, US 199 Million, Brazil 100 Million)"
1837,Where are the leaders of African countries ?  What they do ? Why they can&#39;t organize transportation for the vaccines? The fish start smell from the head.
1838,"Is normal, if a country is poor it get less, that is eternal nothing will ever change that except them selfs"
1839,Oh my Gosh..
1840,I think it&#39;s because women then to be more scared of the side effects
1841,Did not know that there is such a big vaccine gender gap in my country (India). Our news channels are not covering this. Thanks for the information.
1842,"Where are the NGOs?  Can’t they help with transport and additional workers, if needed?"
1843,Has anyone here been given the Jab? (Using my South African accent)
1844,We don&#39;t even use the jab <br>I don&#39;t know why you keep sending them SMH 😕😒
1845,Keep your vaccines let&#39;s keep our lives please

1847,The rumor clip shows Tanzania not Kenya
1848,🇸🇩 🚨🛑🤚 HELP OF 🌎 💯 INJECTION 💉😷 ⚕ URGENT IT&#39;S IMPORT IN OTHER POOR COUNTRY 🆗️ 👆🙌 ❤🙏
1849,"«if they’re not vaccinated, are they able to take care about those in need” whatttt my grandmother was a doctor , she was not vaccinated, and yes she was able to treat people! You can imagine that?! The doctor / nurse treats people, not because she/he’s vaccinated, but because it’s her mission. Following those words from vid, therefore we can say “ if they don’t have tuberculosis, then how they can understand the tuberculosis-patients and how they are able to treat them” ! Are u in your mind, dear media?"
1850,Neva trust ya enemies folks.
1851,"You people still believe Africa is a country, huh?<br>It&#39;s not, and btw, neither is Europe.<br>Back to school, kids."
1852,Africa have had a lot of experience with bill gates.
1853,Good thing women have stronger immune systems.😆

1857,This sounds like a cultural issue in Africa and less of a vaccine issue.

1861,"The reason there is a shortage of medical staff is  poor pay, miserable working conditions, little support and unreasonable demands. I could also never understand how, in the UK, with an increasing population, hospitals were being closed one after the other."
1862,My wife is 52. Her lifelong passion for nursing has turned to burnout and she&#39;s done. She isn&#39;t the only one in our circle talking about early retirement.
1863,"While health care is under rated by most countries, military over rated it&#39;s not so hard to see, why there is a lack of hospitals and nursing personal. Who likes to work for low wages and extreme working conditions ???   🤔"
1864,An average football player earns more in a day than a health care worker earns over an year. How on earth would anyone be interested to become a health care worker. I salute the people who are working in these conditions keeping their own lives in danger. Governments should focus on health care workers ASAP !!
1865,“How can we bolster health care systems for future pandemics.”<br><br>Let’s start with not throwing away skilled nurses just because they don’t want to follow the agenda...
1866,"Most healthcare systems never had the optimum healthcare staff: patient ratios, this pandemic just exposed the lack of preparation to deal with a crisis."
1867,I retired last year at 62.  Covid and the lack of respect was the straw that broke me.  It used to be so fulfilling now I’m done.
1868,Bless all medical care ppl around the world.
1869,Have politicians on the floor with the hospital workers once a week/month. Leaders who are not on the floor with the workers is like having no leader and support at all.<br><br>The formal lip services and announcements made to the public isn’t caring or working with the health workers. 👁 👄 👁  🏥
1870,Six years ago I worked as a carer in a very rich european country...receiving as much per hour as if I worked in the same country in a restaurant
1871,"Moral injury?  That&#39;s a cute term for PTSD, it&#39;s natural working your life away for a sick system that doesnt care about you any more then its victims. We all knew a pandemic was coming, and that our healthcare systems were too small and misaligned for lifestyle injuries and pain management. It was never my job to fix any of this, I pay my taxes, but how long will my sentence be for their continued failure? Whoever stole all the money should probably do something with it."
1872,If they haven’t built portable hospitals with ventilators yet they need to be sued. They had two years and China built a hospital with a 100000 beds in 10 days.
1873,I know in the US in WA state they need to take care of their employees a lot better. The staff never gets their breaks and they don&#39;t offer any kind of massage therapy at the hospital well their working. I can&#39;t believe they don&#39;t care for their employees health when they work 12 to 16 hour work days.
1874,"Govt, administration have not been investing enough money in healthcare, housing, retirement homes. Taxation at high rates, but not giving services proportionately."
1875,Jamaica does not pay medical staff enough. Many leave. Health care here is sad and scarry
1876,"South Korea&#39;s initial strict actions were misunderstood by the citizens certainly, Indians have experienced in the form of 2nd wave. Hope now Koreans learn from their mistakes ASAP."
1877,We haven&#39;t even bolstered health care for the current pandemic and it&#39;s been 2 years 🙄
1878,By spending the tax base and not stealing it.
1879,Good question!Became too expensive!<br>Perhaps the 1% 💰privileged owning all the wealth of the🌏 planet could pay for it!🤔
1880,"Every time we go through a pandemic, are they gonna referr back to covid-19 and do comparisons of what was what???"
1881,Praying for all the south korean God will help you from the philippines
1882,The real question is how can we prevent future pandemics? What is the root cause of the pandemics? If we cant solve the root cause then we are just running around circles.
1883,International community should give more priority to the health care people
1884,"More hospital space,more socialized European model in US,Better remedy education like elderberry syrup and ginger for immunity and other natural remedies and nutrition education 😃"
1885,U.K Government was throwing a christmas party during the worst of U.K lockdown so you best believe I&#39;ll be following their lead and doing the same this year especially as this year we&#39;re in a better situation than back then.
1886,Give the bill to the ones in power the are responsible for this virus we are all victims
1887,Sad to hear.why vaccination hasn&#39;t been done enough?
1888,"Apply the following diet plan strictly for some days during covid 19 infection and you have no fear of any type of pneumonia and inflammation. <br>Non - inflammatory food list <br>1. All the meaty products [everything, like eggs,  pork, beef, mutton, chicken, fish etc.(eat them  grilled or boiled or you can use pure mustard oil or pure butter clarified to cook them )] . <br>2. Wheat ( and all the products that are made from pure wheat, not biscuits or cookies because they contain vegetables oil). <br>3. Gram, cheakpea( chana or kabuli chana). Masoor dal. <br>5. Green leaves like spinach, lettuce, etc.  ( green leaves mustn&#39;t be sour or bitter ). <br>6. All the Derry products (they must be made of pure animal milk like butter clarified,  curd, cheese, fresh milk ). <br>7. Pure Mustard oil, turmeric powder, red chili powder , white sugar, sea salt, coriander powder and leaves, butter clarified. <br>8. Lemon and curd ( lemon and curd are non - inflammatory things  but they act differently with different  foods, with the suggested foods these things would never be a cause for inflammation). <br>If someone  get affected with covid 19, he must avoid lemon for some days because he already would have eaten something that lemon acts as inflammatory thing. But if the patient  eating strictly the suggested diet for more than 18 days then he can add lemon  in his regular diet it will never be inflammatory then. The patient has to apply this diet plan very very strictly because consumption of a single fruit, dry fruit, vegetable, or non suggested grain, lentil or vegetable oil can affect the whole result. <br>Note- feed your infants with mother milk or pure animal milk,( formula  milk acts like a poison during the covid 19 infection because it contains vegetables oil.<br>(if the patient follows this diet plan strictly his body acts over covid 19 like an animal body does, he may  get affected  but  never faces the worst ),,.."
1889,The health care works do not feel valued? How about those that are unvaccinated? The health care workers are treating patients bad because they are unvaxxed.  It goes both ways.
1890,You can start by paying nurses decent money. At least 4K EUR after tax.
1891,"Listening to the first minute of this: why do you spin leaving health care personal to blame the unvaccinated??? Is there an agenda on dw to refer to the unvaccinated as negatively and as often as possible?<br>What is your aim in this? Split society, unperson unvaccinated people and finally get rid of them in one way or another?"
1892,OPEN A STADIUM FOR JUST COVID! SEPARATE VACCINATED FROM INVACCINATED
1893,I have an idea.  Stop making viruses in labs!
1894,How can we bolster healthcare systems for future pandemics? Let me guess. More vaccines!! That seems to be our governments&#39; only response for any and all things related to this pandemic.
1895,More media outlets and powerful figures need to be talking about the long term and PERMANENT damage to our health care systems. <br><br>I don&#39;t think enough people are aware and therefore act more recklessly in spreading the virus
1896,Why are you posting same report each day? <br><br>The stage is set for US pharmaceutical companies who have prepared the covid pills. They will now sell to developed countries at high price and donate free in Africa. No one question them 🤣
1897,Dont treat those that are unvaccinated.
1898,Well considering hospital admissions are lower this year than the previous 5 years I think we&#39;ll be fine
1899,How to bolster healthcare? Here&#39;s an idea: Tax the rich.
1900,"DW News is not where I get my news from, frankly."
1901,"Let me guess , Korea must be giving everyone with MRNA vaccine right ?<br><br>Singapore, Germany, Dutch, Austria now Korea have same problem.<br><br>Compare it with country using AZ and Sinovac."
1902,Never ending Covid
1903,"Governments can implement laws, regulations and mandates overnight... but somehow they can&#39;t be on the side of doctors and nurses. If an unvaccinated patient comes in, they should go to the back of the line, the government can take the brunt of the criticism, it&#39;ll survive. Doctors and nurses... they don&#39;t have a choice."
1904,THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE BUT POLICY MAKERS CHOOSE TO PUT FOOD INTO THEIR MOUTH VIA THE EAR INSTEAD DIRECT FROM THE PLATE. POLICY MAKERS NEED TO LEARN FROM UTTAR PRADESH. PROBABLY JAPAN TOO. LOOK AT THEIR NUMBERS. AND THE MEDIA IS GUILTY TOO.
1905,Main thing is have international law banning all bio labs around the globe.
1906,Didn’t the Chinese build a massive hospital in like 5 days?
1907,Anyone unvaccinated and gets COVID requiring hospitalization should be paying the bill
1908,"Pesticides are the best solution. No virus, no bugs. Einen guten Appetit."

1911,"We&#39;re all going to die one day ,so stop worrying and get on with it"
1912,Why wouldn’t you want to get a vaccination that would stop a pandemic and possibly save your or a loved ones life?<br>Republicans?
1913,"...Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall..."
1914,"Staff shortages makes sense when I keep seeing 7 per patient, with 5 doing nothing."
1915,"How about , keeping the high hope and be supportive!? People , some of us, had problems due the vaccination in past! Beside this, why to accepte something that don.t do what promissed!? There are with rish those jabs, maybe, homeopathy work wonders, like.n 1918! Unfortunatly it.s 2 much Em radiation, that neutrialise the homeopathic remedies!!&quot;water memory&quot;= Luc Montagner&quot;! But.s still hope!"
1916,Lol that Chinese speaking about health 😜
1917,Two sneezes and the world freezes
1918,Should have been an outdoor worker. But no that wasn&#39;t cool amongst my girlfriends growing up.
1919,Wonder why no one talks about natural immunity. After all humans have existed since thousands of years. Why do we suddenly need a genetic engineering now?
1920,Interesting
1921,hire nurses from the philippines. they are the best of the best. they love and care the patients.
1922,"I am fully vaccinated and will soon get a booster shot, but the head doctor in the video said that 20% of intensive care units are filled with non vaccinated people (@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hs5DGMh9jA&amp;t=2m15s"">2:15</a>).That means 80% is filled with people who are vaccinated and fell ill or what? I might be missing something, Are vaccinated people falling ill and being admitted to intensive care units in such numbers? Any honest answers please!"

1926,What can we learn from countries that did a good job?<br>- Control of the citizens through a mobile app
1927,Recruit doctors and nurses from other european/asian countries who can speak English and let them handle patients who can speak English in this way the doctors who only know German can deal with German speaking patients and don&#39;t get overwhelmed!!
1928,How do you deal with this problem?  Start by not pretending that it&#39;s about money.<br><br>1) Kick the MBA&#39;s out of the top rank of decision making.  <br>2) Train more staff. Period.<br>3) Expand facilities to handle greater capacity (see #1 above).<br>4) Educate the public.  Stop acting as if medicine is some kind of arcane knowledge.  Decrease the workload.<br>5) Acknowledge that certain interested parties are holding the society hostage (see #1 above).<br><br>Take the money out of the equation and you will find that the solution is right in front of you.  <br>.
1929,Soon the price of health care will far exceed the cost of living : (

1948,We are with you South Africa. Your scientists are doing an amazingly my job.
1949,"Thank pyou to South Africa for its transparency. Thank you for your honest reporting.  So sorry it has to be this country to find it but it may end up of a benefit, helping to develop population immunity with much milder symtoms with less physical damage."
1950,I applaud you South Africa ❤️<br>Thank you from the US 🙏
1951,I hope this variant will end the pandemic.
1952,Thank you South Africa! We love you!
1953,"As much as it spreads faster, I&#39;m praying🙏 that symptoms with omicron remain mild to moderate...and that it should dominate over the more virulent coronaviruses.."
1954,When travel can resume the world should thank south Africa by visiting as much as possible. We own the nations scientists a deep debt of gratitude.
1955,"I don’t understand we other countries are panicking. We’re literally going on with life like the past 3 months with slight more hospitalisation, very few deaths and mild symptoms. We’re learning to live with it."

1959,My solidarity with African Brothers and sisters ❤
1960,Stay safe our south Africans brothers and sister ❤❤❤❤
1961,That&#39;s what happened with the Spanish Flu. The Spanish newspapers of the day where the only ones who were objectively reporting what was going on and the country got branded with the nickname...
1962,Omicron is a more transmissable variant but the cases are showing to be much milder which could help achieve herd immunity sooner.
1963,cases mean nothing unless they result in hospitalizations and or deaths.
1964,Gets me how our government in the US is blowing this out of proportion and the media is just loving it
1965,"Interestingly, South Africa was not requiring people to be vaccinated to enter the country and was enjoying the unvaccinated tourism and now, having a huge spike, feels they are being punished."
1966,"I don&#39;t get it.  Omicron doesn&#39;t make you very sick, whereas delta can make you very, very sick.  So what&#39;s the big deal with omicron?"
1967,"Other countries want to reduce the seeding rate from places where Omicron is rampant, same as South Africa put travel bans in earlier."
1968,"America loves Southern Africa! ❤️ Thank you for what you did, and sorry about the political ban 😞 - American people are very critical about it, and we are demanding our leaders do better! 💜💙💛💚🧡"

1972,Even delta was mild for young people. The carnage began about a month into delta when it hit the old folks. Let&#39;s see.
1973,"Huge gratitude to Wolfgang, Derrick and DW, excellent segment on what we know and are still waiting to find out on Omicron. 👍🙏"
1974,Hope everything ok ☺️
1975,Omicron rates down from  Saturday 1600 to 600 yesterday in South Africa
1976,After the previous strains what were the other countries supposed to do? They had to try and minimize the threat by closing borders.
1977,"So the virologist criticises the countries which have stopped passenger travel to SA yet he praises the cancellation of a local festival. Mr virologist, cutting the transmission rate in other countries is more important then feeding the SA tourist season"
1978,"Omicron isn’t shaping life in SA, politician’s and government are! Interesting how the media uses language these days."
1979,Well done South Africa.<br>Great reportage from Cape Town
1980,Guy says its seems less severe but then says it’s early in the disease course and young people are the ones infected. How can you conclude less severe with those caveats?!
1981,So if it’s less severe why the panic?
1982,"Whe have 50 cases of the Omicron virus in Europe, and no one of them has ended in hospital."
1983,Virologist Kaiser:  Large group gatherings should not be allowed.  Also virologist Kaiser:  Tourism should not be restricted.  Seems contradictory.
1984,"Since the Omicron variant shows less threatening symptoms, my very next question would be: &quot;How likely is this variant to mutate compared to the other variants?&quot;<br>I&#39;d assume the gene sequence could tell us if its more or less likely to mutate but that might not be accurate."
1985,"Yes, omicron will have higher transmission rate but it will be milder. These are effects and consequences of biological evolutional law, which governs  the behavior and biology of viruses too."
1986,"Judging from the title, Omicron Persei 8 has an emmissary in South Africa ! Please introduce him/her to the rest of the world as soon as humanly possible. The new and internationally authorized correct spelling of emmissary appears here for the first time in printed history. You&#39;re welcome."
1987,"Yeah, our scientists are getting a lot of flak for telling everyone what was going on, even though symptoms are so mild😅 you can&#39;t win"
1988,"Just let this sink in. South Africa is testing a lot and they have a lot of cases of the new omicron variant. Meanwhile, its neighboring countries don&#39;t test a lot and they don&#39;t have a lot of covid cases. Their hospitals are also mostly covid free. It seems that not giving attention to the covid virus and living life as usual is the way to treat this Wuhan virus."
1989,"Now we hear of two zoo hippos testing positive, cats and deer also, can we catch it from animals and, if so, how do we differentiate between human and animal transmission to humans? Could this, even in part, be the reason for such fast spreading in Africa?<br>Pointless locking us all down if the cat gives it to you?"
1990,Be content when we are still healthy and survive.
1991,Why not talk about how the infection is not effecting serious concern. And rate of hospitalizations and recovery rate. Without giving all bad news..is not that your responsibility.
1992,It is a sign of virus weakening. Good sign. That’s the way it subsides . Good for everyone
1993,Is there any possibility you are likely to get it worse the second / third time of having covid? Thanks
1994,No point in travel bans ... !
1995,"I never saw it as being punished. It was more on taking precautions. Ofcourse we thank South Africa for telling the world about this! On the other hand, we have to learn from previous experience. Thank you South Africa! We will get over this soon!"
1996,"I&#39;m sorry, but it doesn&#39;t make sense to me to complain about travel bans being implemented, yet being in support of shutting down music festivals.  Maybe if you backed this up with a mathematical model, I might be able to follow this.  But travel is long distance, so really spread the variant across the world rapidly.  If it is safe because of testing or vaccination, it should be possible to make the music festival safe, since it has lower chance of spreading the variant across long distances."
1997,"The more data we receive, the less it seems to me that I need to be vaccinated.. Data is often a stubborn thing."
1998,Prayers for South Africa 🙏
1999,Cutting of South Africa was not a punishment it was done to slow the progress and give other countries a chance to prepare.
2000,I hope it&#39;s the last time you guys announce a variant in South Africa. Let other countries announce it from now onwards.
2001,South Africa is a transparent country unlike many others
2002,Anybody who avoids south Africa because of anything. You&#39;re missing out.  The land of all seasons through out the whole year.
2003,Why not the good news at the BEGINNING of the report?😉
2004,Other countries are smarter than the united states on this health crisis in my opinion because other countries out there have 80% population vacinated the united states don&#39;t there logic were Smarter handling it better.
2005,Love from Italy to SA! 🇿🇦 🇮🇹
2006,No shutdown. Live your life.
2007,I love the man accent thank u for keeping us informed😊
2008,"they must not see this as punishment it is just normal, keep the virus as contained as possible until the other countries get a little ready for it"
2009,Maybe this variant will be endemic 🤷🏻‍♀️
2010,🇿🇦 South Africa 🇿🇦 identified both 🇿🇦Beta 🇿🇦and 🇿🇦 Omicron 🇿🇦 4th wave begins 🇿🇦 so far predominantly younger groups have been infected 🇿🇦 can reinfect folk who previously had a different variant of covid 🇿🇦 can infection folk who are fully vaccinated 🇿🇦 can infect people with partial immunity 🇿🇦 <br><br>🌎 world travel bans on South Africa 🇿🇦 livelihoods &#39;all but ruined&#39; <br><br>🇿🇦 wrong time to be holding mass participation events  🇿🇦<br><br>🇿🇦 vaccination rates are far too low  🇿🇦<br><br>🇿🇦 events in the open air and with very low numbers only  🇿🇦 <br><br>🇬🇧 found Alpha<br>🇿🇦 found Beta<br>🇿🇦 found Omicron<br><br>🌎 global community is risking good will with  🇿🇦 how South Africa has been treated 🇿🇦
2011,"I live in south africa , we are fine, nothing to worry about just yet."
2012,"Such a large country SA, and yet no other industries other than tourist based?"
2013,Contrast to China&#39;s lack of disclosure - have they learned?
2014,Younger people will only have mild symptoms of they are healthy older people with health conditions will have worse symptoms
2015,Africans are so lucky. They will have mild symptoms and become protected. No need for vaccines that no one really tested properly.
2016,What about Anti-Corruption Vaccine?
2017,I wish there were other ways to stop the spread without punishing the South African people.
2018,"thank you south africa , much love from usa .... we love you  ..i will not fear the virus , like phorah did the plagues , i fear the MOST HIGH .............. GOD BLESS SOUTH AFRICA"
2019,"So would South Africa wish to follow in the footsteps of the Chinese and leave the entire world in ignorance. <br>The retribution would have been far worst from the G10 countries.<br>South Africa did the right thing, it can attend to its citizens. Even if the world cuts it off in regards travel there will still be trade and commerce and more importantly no sanctions, which would have been the case if South Africa had kept schtum."
2020,"japan has 60 cases of covid per day now, they gave permission for doctors to proscribe ivermectin on 13 /08/2021"
2021,Shame on all you murderers!! Your da  uh will come. Good always prevails over evil!!
2022,Sorry you are being punished for doing the right thing. I guess you learned your lesson.
2023,Covid is becoming more like cryptocurrency.
2024,Here in europe we have more problem with the Vaccicron variant.
2025,Why plan a event in the middle of a pandemic ?
2026,How many deaths?   What are the Omicron deaths vs Delta?
2027,Another Booster Promo from another News Source Good Job DW 👌
2028,What&#39;s next after omicron...<br>Atticus variant<br>Calico variant<br>Septicoucious variant<br>These variants are out there somewhere.
2029,Amazingly misinforming...
2030,"SA should have told WHO first, and let them make the announcement"
2031,Life Long and healthy for future parties. But for now just stay home and healthy.
2032,Spike protein radically changed --- the disiese outcome changed = the spike protein itself the root of the problem (?)
2033,Borderline criminalized? I’ll show you criminalized!🧐
2034,"He showed more credibility by fulfilling his promise. Big thanks to 👆 for the 22,000 euro sent"
2035,Yet you have no problem having people die because of your business.    What’s the definition of evil.
2036,Why could they not test the students after the festival ??
2037,So they took their experience and moved a lot faster. That will get attention next time
2038,We were definitely punished with the travel ban.
2039,The world should thank China for this!!
2040,Amazingly misinforming
2041,They got so beat up prior to this that they&#39;ll be fine. It&#39;s everybody else I&#39;m concerned about.
2042,Thank God
2043,"We here in UK got punished by EU nations when we discovered a variant as we had far better testing than EU. We didnt complain, neither should SA."
2044,That&#39;s the problem life got back to normal.  We can&#39;t have that they want total control.
2045,And I&#39;m pretty sure this dint start in Africa everyone ran to Africa when bans were lifted.there rates were the lowest til people started coming down there . There has been transmission between people in places were know one has been to Africa at all ! Community transmission on islands how . By numbers they would be least possible to promote mutations.
2046,Sad until now I&#39;m still waiting for Z variant.
2047,"As always, we&#39;d love to include your questions in our upcoming shows! What would you like to know about the coronavirus pandemic? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23askderrick"">#askDerrick</a>"
2048,These young people are the ones I like to hear. What a delightful and intelligent young man.
2049,"at the end, you&#39;re talking about US. Fine. But how about Portugal &amp; Israel? With almost 90% vaccination rate they are still in lockdown, travel ban (Israel) and high surge of the 4th wave. Why? Why should people vaccinate if that is expected anyway? Just for mitigating the personal risk? It might not be enough.(signed: a vaccinated reader)."
2050,"When you speak about vaccinated vs unvaccinated, please refer to demographics, otherwise your assertions are meaningless. Unvaccinated children get over covid much easier than vaccinated adults and elderly who have breakthrough infections. Breakthrough infections, by the way, are becoming very common amongst those who received their dose five or more months in the past."
2051,Just wondering when you say unvaccinated do you also mean the same issues apply to those who have recovered?
2052,"Omikron, our savior? Omikron has exponential rate growth detected in the south-african sewer systems. But hospitals do not fill with omicron cases. In fact, omicron cases are incidentally detected on patients that came in for other illnesses. Comparison of previous waves (Pw) vs omicron wave (Ow): <br>Length of hospital stay: Pw: 7.8 vs Ow: 2.8 days. Need for Oxygen: Pw: 70% vs Ow 30%. Despite the dramatic rise in the case rate for the Gauteng Province there is an absence of any significant increase in in-hospitals deaths. Too early to draw conclusions but the trend is promising."
2053,The US CDC director just said (yesterday) that over 75% of covid deaths were in people with at least four comorbidities with average age at TOD of 72 years old.
2054,The US CDC director just said (yesterday) that over 75% of covid deaths were in people with at least four comorbidities with average age at TOD of 72 years old.
2055,&quot;We lie. We cheat. We steal.&quot;<br>-Pompeo
2056,If all dies then there will be no need of lockdown 😆
2057,"J Bhattacharya, is the Head of Medicine at Stanford University California (and also an expert in infectious diseases) and recently said “the lockdowns were the biggest public health mistake, of all time.”"
2058,Vaccine and testing mandates will have to be the strategy.
2059,There is this thing where governments ignore that Delta spreads well enough among the vaccinated to be problematic and not consistent with their narratives.<br><br>The epidemiological relevance of the COVID-19-vaccinated population is increasing - The Lancet Regional Health – Europe<br><br>COVID-19: stigmatising the unvaccinated is not justified - The Lancet <br><br>There are problems with the official narrative.
2060,The hairdo of this guest is a lot scarier than covid to be honest 🤨🤨
2061,This is dragging uncessarily long cause we &#39;entertain&#39; their stuvidity to the extent now they are &#39;biting&#39; us hard.<br><br>What needs to be done to reverse this is to get ourselves united in all fronts and fight all out!!<br><br>We need to stop giving &#39;stage&#39; to these jokers...ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!!<br><br>let&#39;s go Brandon!!
2062,Getting the balance right should start with an equitable distribution of vaccines
2063,“Its getting easier”. Almost becoming a way of life”. aka “a new normal”
2064,How about we just start to fine people for getting sick.
2065,Is to get the anti vaxers get treated by anti vax professionals. It&#39;s going to be lovely.

2067,What happened to &quot;We will not be able to vaccinate our way out of this&quot;?<br>We vaccinated our way out of Polio and it took only 106 years!
2068,"People who don&#39;t vaccinate probably think:- &quot;why am I going to vaccinate if nothing will change?, If everything will be the same, if I am going to wear a mask, if they are going close everything? If I have to vaccinate again and again?&quot;"
2069,"Hopefully Omicron will be less problematic. Sounds more transmissible, but milder symptoms."
2070,"The difference between Asian and Western, in the street they wear masks no matter what. There were some unmask but mostly they got warnings from others. It doesn&#39;t matter about the effectiveness or being free. It&#39;s all about caring."
2071,"When try to create fear, and the expert does not know the script Very well and he&#39;s lost"
2072,"The right balance is to advise only to people to do this or to do that. If you don&#39;t force people, it will be ok."
2073,"“If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are heading.”<br>Apply the following diet plan strictly for some days during covid 19 infection and you have no fear of any type of pneumonia and inflammation. <br>Non - inflammatory food list <br>1. All the meaty products (everything, like eggs,  pork, beef, mutton, chicken, fish etc. ). <br>2. Wheat ( and all the products that are made from pure wheat, not biscuits or cookies because they contain vegetables oil). <br>3. Gram, cheakpea( chana or kabuli chana). Masoor dal. <br>5. Green leaves like spinach, lettuce, etc.  ( green leaves mustn&#39;t be sour or bitter ). <br>6. All the Derry products (they must be made of pure animal milk like butter clarified,  curd, cheese, fresh milk ). <br>7. Pure Mustard oil, turmeric powder, red chili powder , white sugar, sea salt, coriander powder and leaves, butter clarified. <br>8. Lemon ( lemon is a non - inflammatory thing  but it acts differently with different  foods, with the suggested foods it would never be a cause for inflammation). <br>If someone  get affected with covid 19, he must avoid lemon for some days because he already would have eaten something that lemon acts as inflammatory thing. But if the patient  eating strictly the suggested diet for more than 18 days then he can add lemon  in his regular diet it will never be inflammatory then. The patient has to apply this diet plan very very strictly because consumption of a single fruit, dry fruit, vegetable, or non suggested grain, lentil or vegetable oil can affect the whole result. <br>Note- feed your infants with mother milk or pure animal milk,( formula  milk acts like a poison during the covid 19 infection because it contains vegetables oil.<br>(if the patient follows this diet plan strictly his body acts over covid 19 like an animal body does, he may be get affected  but  never faces the worst ).."

2079,"notice the clips from asian countries: despite the vaccine,  the people are wearing masks.  compare this with the clips from europe. then compare the daily covid cases.  i asked a niece in UK if she is wearing masks. she says no because she is already vaccinated. we here in asia still wear masks because we know that the vaccine will just mitigate the effect and there is still a possibility that we we will be infected depending on the viral load."

2101,"the only way out of this is to remove all restrictions and lockdowns, and let people choose their medical decisions. So simple."

2114,i can tell you this. YOU ARENT LOCKING ME DOWN AGAIN! MERICA!!!
2115,..........Impfstoff  mach  Frei  .   Impfstoff  mach  Frei  .
2116,"I think is also relevant to say that while during the 1st wave European countries were supporting us by hospitalising our patients abroad, we are now showing solidarity to our friends by taking care of their harshly infected citizens, in light of their full domestic ICUs. For example we already started welcoming German patients in Northern Italy."
2117,"I wish Italy a safe and happy holiday season. They certainly deserve it, as they have really taken it on the chin from this devilish virus. Hopefully, for all of us, this new variant will not bring us any nasty surprises."
2118,"The lesson here is: &quot;learn from your mistake&quot;. We messed up so badly at the beginning that it pushed us, for once, to focus on doing things right."

2135,"My God! After almost two years, Germany is still in the learning stage, and that is why Germany has 70k daily."
2136,Excellent report on the Pandemic by DW News.
2137,"As an American I can say this is true......and although the numbers have skyrocketed over the past 2 weeks, the death counts remain rather low....200-300 a day rather than 5000 a year ago."
2138,This aged well! So fun that we were sure to be the best in Europe in November 🙈
2139,Bravo Italia..Im very proud of what they doing here
2140,"I for once am really happy to be an Italian citizen. Miraculously over the past year we had strong and competent leadership. I already got my booster-shot, fast and well organized in a vaccination centre."
2141,"1 in 7 children still suffering from symptoms over 3 months after infection , and we’ve been gas lit for two years being constantly told in US and UK that children aren’t affected."
2142,Bellissima Italy 🇮🇹💋
2143,Italy did the good job
2144,"We&#39;ve learn that  the higher the vaccination rate, the higher the spreading of covid rate. What does that tells you?"
2145,Viva 🇮🇹!
2146,"Im not ok with all of the measures because there is a two class society now that has been ripped apart, but I have to say, bravo Mario Draghi. <br><br>I dont agree with everything he does, but he is really concerned about the citizens and a honest competent man. <br><br>Even if I think we are going in the wrong direction as a society, I appreciate his commitment to his ideas."
2147,Well done Italia. <br>Wish we had a Green Pass and similar measures.
2148,What is problem with Closing schools and cancelling Boards ? <br>Doesn&#39;t government know that it will spread omicron to entire nation ?<br>Poor students and their parents . They will suffer alot.
2149,The media and governments are to blame for not talking about health. We have been in this pandemic for 2 years now. Things would have been very different if we actually promoted health which has the strongest efficacy against infection and death for every disease..
2150,I am proud of my country and 87% of the Italians who are vaccinated. 👍💚❤️🇮🇹
2151,"As always, we&#39;d love to include your questions in our upcoming shows! What would you like to know about the coronavirus pandemic? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23askderrick"">#askDerrick</a>"

2153,"I have got my second Vaccine 💉 3 days ago and feel ok, my recommendation to those who are afraid of it Do Not afraid and get vaccine to save your life and other lives."
2154,"well done. when come to unseen, it should be prepared for the worse, not dreaming for the better. Some government just a joke."
2155,"Viva l&#39;Italia e i Tosi Veneti, una delle poche volte che don fiero di dirlo 🥳😂"
2156,Key words country is behaving. All about control.
2157,Italy was a huge disaster for COVID because of the large number of Chinese traveling to Italy during the first COVID outbreak in the late fall of 2019 and the large elderly population severely suffering because of that very fact.
2158,"Was in italy in september, everyone was wearing masks in public. 👌"
2159,Nothing because it&#39;s a global problem.
2160,This tiny noisy minority.. Props to the Italians for being proper respectful humans
2161,".if you haven&#39;t learned yet to Be protected respecting distancing,something wrong with your brain..."
2162,"If you haven&#39;t heard, Omicron has already slipped past the watchers. A S. African official asked that his countrymen not be banned from travel b/c of Omicron, but S. Africa has its own travel rules. I don&#39;t get it. I also don&#39;t get how this new variant has already turned up in other countries. This has to mean that it was already on the move before scientists discovered it and banning travel from the region could be halted. I think you might need a HAZMAT suit to fly - even in first and business classes."
2163,People are vaccinated mostly in Italy. Unlike those in German
2164,Oh my 💔
2165,"Italy, the next Covid role model... (until the next round)"
2166,"Pumping up image quality, but with no avail !! My eyes were sweating ! :°("

2170,"What is important for italy to fight covid: vaccine, masks, social distancing ...  wow thats some news"
2171,"Shouldn&#39;t be what CAN we learn, more like what HAVE we learned?<br>Well...<br>NOTHING"
2172,"The video is confusing because they are showing Italy has the 2nd highest death rate while they are not doing anything different compared to the other countries with mask mandates and vaccinations......?!?! Don&#39;t forget, Italy has the 4th oldest population, so it was expected they would have a lot of vulnerable people that would pass away..."
2173,"Indeed,  here in Italy we respect the rules dictated by our government,  except the no vax.  Masks,  hand sanitizer,  social distancing,  vaccination, green pass.  Till now it works. Let&#39;s see what the winter brings. I personally will fly to a tropical island for the next six months. Wish all my Italian citizens merry Christmas and a pleasant winter.

2175,Good... Italian fully aware of covid
2176,"one guy asked me, how do I know what the vaccine will do to me in 10  years?  <br>My reply: how do we know what a Chinese made bioweapon will do to you in 10 years?"
2177,What they don&#39;t tell you is that a lot of people are very afraid and wear masks out in the streets and that is maybe why things aren&#39;t so bad. Maybe.
2178,&quot;For the sake of His sorrowful Passion have mercy on us and on the whole world.&quot;

2180,"They taught you, but you don&#39;t learn!"
2181,Bravo..grazie...unvaccinated safe
2182,How could anybody catch the virus skiing on a mountain. 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
2183,"Italians, mostly Roman Catholic, respect human life."
2184,At least they recognize natural immunity. Why can&#39;t America??
2185,"Well, then lets all go to this wonderful covid free country!"
2186,&#39;What can somewhere teach us&#39; videos are funny.  Normally a week or so after media release these you suddenly find that places that are meant to teach us are actually doing badly.
2187,Ítaly teach us that that a Strong people can not be harrassed by a tiranical government
2188,It is very fanny when you can “ see” more then ordinary people. I can not stop to be sad and to laugh sometimes to human beings.
2189,"What we learn here, individual rights is more important then human rights. Individual have the right to spread covid19."
2190,I wish all students will success in their half yearly and board exam ❤️🙏❤
2191,&quot;Maybe that is a question you should ask Chy-na.&quot; DJT
2192,Cases in Italy have rised from 3000 to over 17000 so it&#39;s not looking amazing in Italy. Why doesn&#39;t dw look at Canada where cases are actually not rising to learn from what Canada did right.
2193,"Just about a week ago DW was praising Portugal as the Covid role-model, so don&#39;t go rushing to give yourself a pat on the back."
2194,"When Germany follows the Italian model, it&#39;s never a good sign. I start worrying now 😳"
2195,I can sense goosestepping...
2196,Lessons ? None. Or maybe what we can learn from them is HOW NOT TO face an unknow pandemic threat. Never ever downplay a virus threat as they did last year.
2197,Don&#39;t be a population of 90 yr olds in one of the biggest tourist hubs in the world...
2198,Time to send Germanicus to teach Germania a lesson again.
2199,Definitely wouldn’t want to test the vaccinated!
2200,My kids they had covid but they are the same kicking like tornado.😂
2201,What can you learn from China zero tolerance policy with strict sop and vaccination.???
2202,&quot;Mankind will not have peace until it turns with trust to My mercy.&quot;
2203,"Too early! Last year you said the same about how wonderful Italy was doing in the beginning of Winter 2020, 2 weeks later there was a massive wave.<br><br>Caution! Before jumping into conclusions."
2204,Well italy is euro 2020 champions....what we can learn from that football event??
2205,"It should be: what can CHINA teach you about dealing with COVID19, maybe learn to lockdown like China?"
2206,If you tell an ignorant person that there are one thousand  stars in the sky he will believe it. But if you tell him the seat next to him is just painted he will touch it.
2207,"With all the restrictions and vax, the death rate was high...."
2208,Not all northern Italy only lombardy
2209,Don’t cry victory very soon!!! Vaccination is very very imperfect. With omicron we have to start everything all over again
2210,At least they recognize natural immunity. Why can&#39;t America????
2211,What can we learn from Italy? How to make the perfect pizza.
2212,"&quot;On public transport, only those vaccinated... are allowed on board&quot;. Completely false. Everyone is allowed to take public transportation. The ban is only in long-distance trains. Be more accurate if you want to inform people, thanks."
2213,Italy success
2214,What can we learn from them? That they were defeated by the system. This is only the beginning.
2215,"I do not know of we can teach a lesson, it&#39;s too difficoult to say,  but the majority of us is really trying very  hard! <br>Nowadays,  the secret of happiness, Is protecting  yourself and OTHERS  from COVID 19 <br> Be safe!"
2216,"As always, we&#39;d love to include your questions in our upcoming shows! What would you like to know about the coronavirus pandemic? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23askderrick"">#askDerrick</a>"
2217,"If Omicron is infectious but not “debilitating” or “deadly,” is this a way out of the pandemic as millions get infected and build up a natural immune response?"
2218,"DW, up-to-date information given in a calm, responsible manner. <br>Much appreciated. Viewer in Brazil."
2219,"Excellent, calm factual report. Thank you."
2220,"Very contagious but I don’t have any symptoms besides a slight  cough for a couple days. My symptoms where so slight I doubted myself going for a covid test which came out positive. My mom had the delta wave earlier this year she was very very sick, she was in bed for 3 weeks. With this new wave is South Africa she was only in bed for 3 days. I do believe that omicron is better than delta."
2221,This is why I like DW... nowhere else has reported on the potential of Omicron being a welcomed development. 🤞🤞
2222,I have this strain as we speak! And I’m pregnant with a weak immune system. It was terrible for 2 days for me now it’s just lingering weird taste in my mouth. This strain doesn’t cause respiratory problems like the others you cough yes but breathing is usually fine! We have been okay with this strain so far! The doctors aren’t worried at all they didn’t even wear gloves when treating me or wear gowns when coming in and out of my room when I went to the hospital. The doctor said it’s not a dangerous strain highly contagious but not dangerous
2223,"Thanks to the South Africa authorities for bringing us immediate news of the detection of this new variant, your fast and transparent notice will save lives around the world, by giving everyone more time to ramp up their efforts again."
2224,"Omicron variant!...my opinion is...honestly and seriously speaking, nothing to worry about. Thanks for the information."
2225,"😃 I regularly watch DW COVID-19 special, as it&#39;s quite informative and helpful !!!"
2226,"The extremely rapid dominance of Omicron, it’s rapid spread, and skyrocketing case numbers, in South Africa, indicate that it’s highly transmissible, we need to know about the severity of illness caused by it."
2227,I commend DW for their Special reports on OMICRON  the new dangerous variant in the Pandemic. Question if this Variant was already in Europe  as mentioned was the WHO aware of this and could have alerted the global nations.
2228,Mr Tang is quite optimistic but as he says it&#39;s early days.  Why is loss of taste and smell his bellwether?  Many people who have survived the Delta version have lingering sensory loss.  The loss is not closely associated with mortality or even serious disease.
2229,This channel contributes alot towards my research on this virus. This virus has mutated 3 x from the the original virus. This virus has shown a remarkable trait of mutating so fast. As a South African we see that the symptoms are very mild at the moment..... But... It&#39;s infecting the young in larger proportions in comparison to the original virus.  It seems that as it mutates it tends to be much more effective in infecting a different age-group.
2230,Finally someone with senses and reasons!!!
2231,"It is also feasable that <b>after</b> Omicron, the virus mutates into something more deadly than any other variant so far. The more the virus is allowed to spread, the more likely new variations are to appear so we should continue to develop measures to fight it."
2232,"From all reports coming out of S Africa it is far more infectious , growing very ràpidly and has pretty much replaced Delta there.  So far the incubation period is about 11 days,. From cases in S Africa , it does not appear to be anymore dangerous then Delta , for those vaccinated the symptoms have been mild . A bit more time is needed to see if that will be the case for all catching the O variant ."
2233,"There are loads of mutations, when they are singled out and given some Greek Alphabet name the World goes into panic mode, but they are already around almost everywhere on the planet."
2234,"It’s too early to determine the severity of illness from this variant.  Serious illness takes 9 or more days to develop in the other variants, the majority of those infected with Omicron are still in their first week of illness, before it becomes serious, anyway.  We shouldn’t dismiss this variant until we have adequate data on hospitalization and deaths.  Yes, ideally, a new variant would be harmless, outcompete all others, and be highly transmissible, then everyone eventually would become immune without becoming seriously ill.  Right now all we have is a few casual observations that it doesn’t seem that cases aren’t very serious, but that’s not nearly enough information to make decisions with.  Meanwhile, caution is the correct approach, better to be over-cautious than dismissive and reckless with human lives."
2235,A layman&#39;s question about viruses. Isn&#39;t it in a virus&#39;s best interests if its hosts don&#39;t die? So that a virus would naturally evolve into less deadly forms?
2236,Brilliant Dr. Tang!  Absolutely brilliant!
2237,We should all be worried about strains that have no symptoms or effects
2238,At what point does this just become the flu that we used to have each winter ?
2239,"Omicron, megatron, Optimus prime. It’s more than meets the eye really."
2240,"The bug has animal reservoirs, does that mean it can pass between humans and animals?  Wouldn’t more mutations occur that way?  So, the virus will never end?"
2241,I think its more likely to have a more transmissible variant than a more deadly one as a virus main purpose is propagation and it can multiply faster with a living host. This might be a turn where this pandemic can be more like a seasonal flue as the researchers said. Likewise flu is still an ongoing virus its more benign compared to more deadly ones like ebola or anthrax
2242,"We are talking about omicron as if delta isnt still a threat to a lot of people, despite large vaccination, we havent fully tested our immunity against delta but its easy to shift attention away when something new comes along..."
2243,"Good info. It is bit odd when I hear loud breathing sounds from someone when Dr. Julian is speaking. Hopefully when not talking, let us mute the microphone. Thank you!"
2244,A South African medical doctor stated that Omicron is mild!!
2245,So Omicron being a variant of concern doesn&#39;t mean that they already know it&#39;s dangerous?
2246,Omicron = only &quot;mild&quot; symptoms... on young and healthy patients. &gt;65 years = 6% total SAfr population. EU populations are older and have more comorbidities.
2247,we always manage to give such fancy names to these covid variants .
2248,"All countries should take precautions, to be on the safe side"
2249,"Amazing how many doctors are on here giving, advice, who would have thought 6 months of googling viruses would produce so many experts. What a day and age to be alive lol"
2250,Julian appears on TV in a hoodie &quot;I&#39;m not that concerned.&quot; Well played Julian.
2251,Soooooo this could be the end 🤞🏽 I’m remaining optimistic. If it remains mild let’s open the world up and get on with life
2252,"I really hope this ends I just want to live life without being scared of going anywhere, I care so much about my family members :(❤️"
2253,"It&#39;s been a few weeks since Omicron was first reported, if it&#39;s serious u would know keeping my fingers cross!"
2254,How about offering monoclonal antibody treatment to everyone when they show symptoms instead of pushing vaccines that are having more breakthroughs?
2255,It would be amazing if this is less deadly ! It would finally be an end
2256,It looks like a WW2 sea mine. Scary 😱
2257,Need more people like Julian Tang 👍
2258,finally some good news :)
2259,Since the covid 19 was engineered in Wuhan virology Institute then there is NO stopping of various variants mutated from one form to another because come spring time another variant will be evoluting
2260,Why is the world blaming South Africa for this Omicron. It started in Denmark one week before it cam to South Africa. WHY IS THE WORLD BANNING FLIGHTS FROM SOUTH AFRICA. THE WORLD MUST STOP USING SOUTH AFRICA AS the Gilty one.
2261,"This will keep mutating, where will it end? Our best hope it mutates into something less deadly"
2262,"When you think it was the end, so bad 😔"
2263,Don’t worry guys if our ancestors got through the Spanish flu then we are good. 😮‍💨
2264,The Delta and the Omicron are no match for The Alpha and The Omega.
2265,"Next year all the variants are going to link together like a Megazord in Power Rangers. And yes, each one will have power up sequence (obviously)."
2266,My wife and myself ain’t jabbed . She had Corona at the first wave i did not get sick . Now both infected with omicron and having symptoms but it ain’t that bad she is a bit more sick but I’m still doing my calisthenics workouts and while it’s a bit more difficult I’m still able to work out .
2267,Update: 2nd &amp; 3rd cases found in Hawaii &amp; Wisconsin today.
2268,Julian Tang&#39;s comments make a lot of sense to me
2269,"To DW TV. For all your reportage on Covid I think you have missed a critically important issue: the role of criminality in the spread of the virus. Not least of which the transference of the virus on contaminated shipments of smuggled illegal drugs and stolen goods. To all criminals, where greed is concerned, there are no international borders."
2270,when covid started we saw people dying and being hospitalized right away. with this we hear mild flu like symptoms.
2271,Now I have got to watch the sci-fi movie &quot;Omicron&quot; from 1964. Now we are starting to see where this all started.........Forget it. It&#39;s in Italian.  😳😳😳
2272,"The omicron spike key has changed which means vaccine created antibodies may find it harder to attach, but also it makes the virus harder to attach to the ace 2 receptor. Virions  have no momentum from their own side so they rely on randomly  being just at the right angle for the spike to unlock the cell. So I doubt it is more transmissible in the unvaccinated  being a more bumpy key spike,- hence it is benign,  yet more transmissible and more escapable for the vaccinated in that context. Makes one wonder if it is worth modifying the vaccines again if the omicron has turned into a natural benign vaccine anyway? Still I am just guessing and may be  in over my head here so leave it to the experts."
2273,"maybe mild for younger people. my father is 70yo and died of covid, theyre the one we need to protect the elderly."
2274,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsE3DVFxL6o&amp;t=3m36s"">3:36</a> This guy is awesome, he tells the truth. No fearmongering."
2275,"Omicron must be strong, when Omicron comes in the flu went out the backdoor."
2276,Final some good news Amen 🙏💖
2277,I am kind of excited for the Megatron variant already XD
2278,Why would he say it will help very little.🤦🏻🤷🏻 that makes no sense to me because every person you don’t allow went to the country that either came from or traveled through an infected country will be better because thats less of a person to spread it to other people
2279,How many hospitalizations and deaths are occurring? I hope this strain is indicative of the virus becoming endemic so we can focus on the mental illness effects over the best part of the last 2 years. 🙏 There was talk of an oral pill to assist in fighting the virus. Does this look to be any use against the new Omicron?
2280,"Sorry to be pointing this out, DW, but you translated almost everything the Brazilian woman with the umbrella was saying differently."
2281,"If your gonna be afraid of something be afraid of your freedoms being taken away little by little,piece by piece ,"
2282,I like 👍 all the childish drawings of all the covid mutations 🧐
2283,"&quot;I&#39;m normally quite pessimistic, a glass half empty rather than a glass half full sort of a guy&quot; 😂😂  🤜✨🤛"
2284,"I’m not concerned with the boltron, But the wearing of Faceshield again is my worry."
2285,50 people got infected at one Xmas party in a restaurant. Guess this version is definitely more contagious!
2286,The one thing I don’t understand when they tested the person they need to dig it all the way in your nose to find out if you are positive 🥶
2287,"I had CoVid19 in early November 2020, what I consider a moderate case and still, thinking I was over it, tested positive 13 days later... I got the J&amp;J vaccine 3-8-21.  I&#39;m for now holding on the booster because of what I&#39;ve read and seen with some videos.  What does anyone else here advise on getting the booster?  What have you heard?  I got ready to go to Mall of America today, then stopped myself at the last minute.  It would have been a badly needed break... but decided to avoid the risk."
2288,"What I want to know,  is this O Variant going to cause hair loss? <br>I can&#39;t go through another round of Corona!<br>I still can&#39;t taste since February 😔. And in trying to cope with the hair loss!"
2289,No loss of taste or smell? PLEASE it&#39;s the one symptom I&#39;m even mildly worried about!
2290,"What I&#39;m confused about is how on earth did they have a test for this virus before the virus become known, it&#39;s as if the government around the world already knew this &quot;variant&quot; was going to happen and what better way to do it is to get the vaccinated infected with the virus because it causes lesser if not no symptoms at all compared to the other variants. I&#39;ve noticed that original covid,beta and the delta variant has taken a vacation this year and magically for the 2nd year in a row the common cold/flu virus is on vacation something that the flu vaccine hasnt been able to do in over 70 years 🤷‍♀️"
2291,Variant a mutation tend to be weaker then initial virus
2292,Does this mean that soon we will have to get a different kind of vaccines?
2293,Scientists work out at the gym?? So nice 💪🤘
2294,2nd case in Minneapolis. Let&#39;s not all freak out now! Just be careful. 🙂
2295,"Delta is dominant everywhere, so people need to get vaccinated based on the current situation.   We don&#39;t have any data on the new variant yet, some young people in South Africa got mild symptoms - that&#39;s all we have, people should not draw anything from that.  Most people don&#39;t lose taste and smell so this also doesn&#39;t reveal anything significant.   We&#39;re filling news with speculation because there is no data and won&#39;t be any data for weeks."
2296,"It&#39;s the host&#39;s little sharp intake of breath at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsE3DVFxL6o&amp;t=5m57s"">5:57</a> for me."
2297,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsE3DVFxL6o&amp;t=5m06s"">5:06</a> when the expert tells us that the omicrons causes mild symptoms we get to see activities on an intensive care unit on the left, why?"
2298,I wish they&#39;d get a move on (this is in grave danger of ruining my rapt appreciation of the commercials)
2299,"FINGERS CROSSED! Because if it is true that the variant is mild and displaces Delta, then I can only say: Welcome Omicron! 🍀"
2300,Omicron is in the Delta as well as the Alpha quadrant....Ask Commander Chakotay and Captain Janeway... USS Voyager and her crew are dependent on Omicron.
2301,"“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”<br><br>― Frank Herbert, Dune"
2302,It will be as dangerous as you keep describing  it As such for as long as you keep doing it.
2303,I think Covid is going to eventually just be like the Chicken Pox.
2304,They dont want to say 5th 6th or 7th wave so they name it omnicron
2305,Are you guys honestly not bored of the same report every single day?
2306,forcible intimidation of people by their unknown infectious disease became their rule.<br> this process will not stop until they reach their goal.
2307,"Fear the Omicron, fear the Zombicron!"
2308,Keep our fingers crossed 🤞
2309,"Isn&#39;t this unusual for a virious to mutate so quickly? Oh, and btw - strain is a scientific term - variant is mathematical. Just saying."
2310,Does vaccination works against Omicron?
2311,"Yes closing borders will still help, by given us time to research even if it is already in the country! Especially in areas, that do imidiate testing and tracing and so always have kept the virus in check like QLD in Australia. However, if the borders are left open, you run the risk for it to spread even quicker with any new cases coming in, hence less time to find out more about this new strain! So do not spread such nonsense about closing borders is not useful!!"
2312,Take a deeper dive and you might just find another variant! After all that would be so useful for political advantages.
2313,every one they find infected was fully vaccinated so what does that tell you?
2314,Omnicon great name for the new strain.Covid without end.Amen.
2315,"Keep calm and carry on. Panic, fear mongering and outright lies from loonies don&#39;t help."

2334,&#39;Ppl with HIV can live normal lives&#39; except   they don&#39;t because they  get fired/not hired because of stigma.
2335,Stigma is not ideal but it is what keeps people away from it and take care of themselves. Fear is not good but I’m afraid it is essential in human life
2336,"4 It was destroyed, the earth fell; got sick, the world fell; the high peoples of the earth fell ill. 5 And the land was polluted under its inhabitants; because they broke the laws, they distorted the law, they broke the everlasting covenant. 6 For this reason the curse consumed the land, and its inhabitants were laid waste; for this cause the inhabitants of the earth were consumed, and men were diminished.<br>7 The wine is lost, the vine is sickened, all who were merry in heart groaned.<br>8 The rejoicing of the tambourines has ceased, the noise of those rejoicing has ceased, the joy of the harp has ceased.<br>9 They will not drink wine with singing; cider will be bitter to those who drink it.<br>10 The city is broken by vanity; every house has been closed, so that no one can enter.<br>11 There are cries for lack of wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, joy is banished from the earth.<br>12 The city was desolate, and the gate was broken down with ruin.<br>13 For so it shall be in the midst of the earth, in the midst of the peoples, like a shaken olive tree, like gleanings after the harvest.<br>Isaiah 24: 4-13.<br>-<br>6 And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars; See that you are not disturbed, because it is necessary that all this happens; but the end is not yet.7 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be plagues, and famines, and earthquakes in different places. 8 And all this will be the beginning of pain. Matthew 24: 6-8 JESUS.<br>-<br>26 “Just as it happened in the time of Noah, so it will be when the Son of man comes. 27 They ate, they drank, and they married and gave in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark; then the flood came and destroyed them all.<br>28 “The same thing happened in Lot&#39;s time: they ate and drank, bought and sold, sowed and built. 29 But the day Lot left &#39;&#39; &quot;&#39;(Sodom)&quot;&#39; &#39;&#39; it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.<br>30 “So it will be on the day the Son of man is revealed. Luke 17: 26-30 JESUS<br>-<br>9 And when you hear of wars and seditions (protests against their rulers), do not be alarmed; because it is necessary that these things happen first; but the end will not be immediately. 10 Then he said to them: Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; 11 and there will be great earthquakes, and in different places famines and pestilences; and there will be terror and great signs from heaven.<br>Luke 21: 7-11<br>-<br>12 and because wickedness has multiplied, the love of many will grow cold.<br>13 But the one who endures to the end will be saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world, for a witness to all nations; And then the end will come. Matthew 24: 12-14<br>-<br>22 And if those days were not shortened, no one would be saved; but because of the elect, those days will be shortened. Matthew 24:22 JESUS<br>-<br>8 But God shows his love for us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ JESUS ​​died for us.<br>9 For much more, being already justified in his blood, by him we will be saved from wrath.<br>10 For if, being enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we will be saved by his life. Romans 5: 8-10<br>---<br>16 “Because God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son (JESUS), so that everyone who believes in him may not perish, but may have eternal life. John 3:16<br>-<br>18 Come quickly, says the Lord, and let us be aware: if your sins are like scarlet, they will be white as snow; if they are red like crimson, they will be like white wool. Isaiah 1:18<br>-<br>9 that if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.<br>10 For with the heart it is believed for righteousness, but with the mouth it is confessed for salvation.<br> Romans 10: 9-10<br>--23 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans 6:23<br>-<br>12 And in no one else is there salvation; for there is no other name under heaven, given to men, by which we can be saved.

Philippians 2: 10-11<br>-<br>12 But to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God; John 1:12<br>-<br>6 Jesus said to him: I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through me. John 14: 6<br>-<br>23 But the hour is coming, and now is, when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth; because the Father also seeks such worshipers to be adored.<br>24 God is Spirit; and those who adore him, in spirit and in truth it is necessary that they adore.<br>John 4: 23-24<br>27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give you; I don&#39;t give it to you like the world gives it. Not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. John 14:27<br>JESUS.<br>There is power in THE NAME OF JESUS."

2343,本人ではなく他者が、本人の一定の状況を「病気」と認定して、「治療」が必要と評価した時点で、スティグマからは逃れられないと思う。<br>「正常」と「異常」を区別して、「異常」に対して変容を要求するから。<br>本人が、自分を異常だとも思ってないし、治癒という変化も望んでいないときに、スティグマというネガティブ作用が顕著になる。<br>日本に、統合失調症等患者への隔離薬漬け拘束の正当化が象徴的。<br>本人に病識がない、判断能力がないということで、本人を無視して、どんなに残酷な仕打ちも本人の意思を無視して正当化される。自殺数も病床数も異常に多く、退院者による精神科スタッフの思考言動模倣的な猟奇犯罪も少なくない。治療の効果も出てないし、拘束の果てに死んでも正当な治療として平然と正当化される。<br>まさに動物実験状態。<br>私は、苦しい死に方は望んでいないが、早死を避けたいとは思わないし、戦争帰りの人のような知覚過敏や過剰反応症状を薬漬けや拘束により緩和することは望んでいない。<br>都合の良い反応だけ観察して利用するくせに、型に押し込めて苦しめたり見えなくすることも平然と強要し死ぬことも許さずひたすら延命して恩に着せる医療従事者たちの異常な感覚や発想は、残酷な動物実験やイエス・キリストの姿を搾取マニュアルとして活用するような腐った人間性が蔓延しているから可能なのだろう。<br>HIVは、ミュージカル「RENT」では「ドラッグ中毒の貧困若者」、QUEENのFreddie Mercuryさんは「移民の同性愛者」というマイナリティの被差別者層の生き方を美しく共感できるようにクローズアップすることで、偏見からくる不必要に極端な排除行為の防止に役立ったのではないかと思う。<br>毒を毒をもって制する。<br>完全な拮抗、完全な中和はバランスが難しく、予想外のタイミングでどちらかの悪影響が顕在化することはありうると思う。<br>差別はいけないと必要以上に抽象化した思想統制をすることもまた悲劇をうみかねない。<br>多数派と区別して治療する意義があるのに、それを認識できなくする作用も生じるから。<br>差別を煽りたい側が、被差別者層の特質と必要以上に関連付ける政治的な無意識の現れにも留意が必要かも。<br>移民、同性愛、貧困、マイナス評価されやすい少数派である。それだけで生きる意欲を失い免疫機能が衰える要素は十分にある。

2365,"The part where she said ‘if kids get vaccinated they don’t have to stay at home when they get sick’ is not true, vaccinated kids still have to stay home when they test positive at our school. I’m not against vaccine, just stating a fact."
2366,They&#39;re rightly concerned.  Kids are having heart attacks and other heart problems.  Settlements have arbitrary been made in court.  This is the biggest crimes against humanity in the history of humanity.
2367,"poor kids man, they dont know what they are being jabbed with :("
2368,"Leave the kids alone, murderers"
2369,So unnecessary. How can parents not be concerned about long term effects and short term serious injury?
2370,"If suffering acute illnesses in childhood helps develop resistance to difficult situations in later life, is it healthy to have an absence of illnesses as a child?"
2371,Why aren’t all parents concerned and saying no??!!
2372,"Imagine being afraid for your children in this. Only 621 children in the U.S. aged 0-18 have passed out of 49M cases. Those odds are 78,905 to one. They&#39;re actually more at risk by walking down the street at 623 to one. It&#39;s approximately the same as lightning at 83,930 to one. But I&#39;ll bet these parents would let their kids walk down the street in a storm."
2373,Hundreds of kids have died in the US of covid???? We had maybe 2 dead kids under the age of 9 in Croatia since the beginning of the pandemics. We are only 4 millions people but still ... Something is VERY wrong with this world and some parents as well

2383,<b>if you do the vaccine you get superpowers!</b> blackmailing.
2384,Heart inflammation/damage markers are on the rise. In a low risk group it is a good thing to be cautious.
2385,"What a poor, doomed strategy to get rid of covid!"
2386,By  nature  which  type  of  pathogen  is  every  mutant  leads  to  think that  improvement  for  every thing  is  necessary  everytime.
2387,The vaccinated kids can still infect their grandparents. The grandparents need to be vaccinated.
2388,"aw look, they&#39;re doing their part in helping thin the herd<br>.....oops, meant herd immunity 🙂"
2389,Wow!  You are able to develop a vaccine even though it doesn&#39;t exist yet!  Really??!!
2390,"Many parents concerned,  wonder what God&#39;s concern is"
2391,"&quot;They are going to have superpowers&quot;?  Why don&#39;t you just say that &quot;Santa will bring you extra presents&quot; or &quot;Then Jesus will love you&quot; or &quot;You won&#39;t kill your grandparents&quot;?  Look, everyone needs to do what they need to do...but if this goes sideways, there isn&#39;t any one of these kids that will ever forgive us, for just letting this all happen."
2392,"Covid is a medical opportunity! No such opportunities will be unutilised. This is the nature of all careerist segments. <br><br>Therefore, all careerists based on their significance  unite and utilize all related opportunities. <br><br>This is the side effect of political class, nationalism, unions of nations like EU and social thrust."
2393,"Well,for sure it is a great way to divide people... and who said United we stand divided we....."
2394,They have better immunity but susceptible to vaccine injury. Vaccines should be given to the old and sickly which has higher vaccine tolerances.
2395,¿We as Parents could &quot;condemn&quot; Our Proper Kids to be vaccinated all Life Long two times per Year minimum?
2396,"I&#39;m Soo heart bcos , you still believe, , in vaccine,"
2397,Not me just watching cuz ill have vaccine tommorow
2398,beautiful
2399,Also what kind of parents letting their children to get jab? I&#39;m sorry but even as a fully vaxxed person id wait before allowing my children to get one.
2400,Concerned that it hasn’t been tested on children and that it wasn’t affected for adults? What....?
2401,It takes 5 years to research  they did not do that
2402,Love how they called it <b>*THE JAB*</b> 😬
2403,The vaccine &quot;expert&quot; lost her hair....
2404,I&#39;m also against that forms of coercion
2405,Yes we need to be educated more
2406,what we know for sure is that they&#39;re not needed! More side effects than benefits!
2407,No!  We all saw it when they said that covid has no effect on children!!  Is this a mutation of words or definitions?  Hahahaha!
2408,My kid is not getting the vaccine
2409,Not enough information is known.  That’s why they are taking 3 jabs.  They should have known that 3 jabs would be needed from the beginning if proper studies had been done.
2410,Pfizer’s CEO on the need for endless boosters:<br><br> “I think we&#39;re going to have an annual revaccination and that should be able to keep us really safe.&quot;<br><br>How do people not see that this is a non-stop advertising campaign?
2411,"More jabs more virus versions,  it find a way to mutation. Superpower? 🤦🏽‍♀️"
2412,Maybe we should criminalize misinformation.
2413,"I&#39;m thankful that my daughter is old enough now to make the decision on her own. I was forced to get the vaccine to keep my job, otherwise, I would have waited until the time was right for me."
2414,"Don&#39;t give poison to your kids, thank me later!!!"
2415,Super power? False security.
2416,Over my dead body
2417,She is kissing  faucei  but she  makes commission on each shot like doctors offices
2418,When does this all stop ? Keep jabbing them every time a new one comes out? Hurd immunity with out the jab is the right way I think

2450,My Father also wanted to live. He was 71 and he was very active hard working. He used to tell people that one astrologer told him that he would live untill 82. But in first wave he lost to covid. He also served as secretary of community but in covid pandemic he was taken to cremation ground in municipal van. It was so tragic saddening. Fortunately we were allowed to perform last rites. It is really saddening to see family members were not allowed to visit hospitals in first wave of pandemic. Corona is really bad very bad. Suddenly everybody abandons diseased person.
2451,He forgot to mention that survival rate tends to drop for hospitalized patients if enough adequate treatment and care is unavailable or reduced.
2452,"Praying for Germany. I wonder how many excess deaths theyve experienced on top of covid deaths. Just horrible. <br><br>I pray relief is coming for that country, and all countries that need it most, soon"
2453,"It&#39;s  so   sad  and tragedy  ,I hope Germany passed out the pandemic ,I&#39;m  sorry for all  losses thier  lifes ..safe  and healthy for all german puplic"
2454,100K deaths over SARS-COV-2 is just appalling. The overwhelming majority of those deaths were preventable.
2455,I lost my close friend too.. I see by my self how she strungle for a week to fight this virus.. 😭
2456,Germany.... Get well soon... We are keep on praying for you...
2457,"There is a balance to everything - belief and disbelief, in the ability to say I know and ability to say I don&#39;t know, to say I&#39;m intelligent in some things but incompetent on others, to know when to make assumptions and when the risks are too high if the assumptions I make happen to be wrong, to understand that sometimes the scale shifts more to the left (sacrifice) before it can shift back to the right (freedom). Without a supple mind, you can achieve almost nothing good."
2458,"Sad to hear this ,all shall pass sooner and faster  than we think, R.I.P to our love one&#39;s,and my condolence to all affected German&#39;s by the CV19"
2459,"I&#39;m in a high risk group, this appears to be the solution to the retirement crisis plus the older generations appear to have the hardest time accepting the changing demographics of the western world!"
2460,Soo sadly 😔 I’m very sorry 😞
2461,My heart goes  out to Germany.hope things will  get  better. 🇩🇪♥️😥
2462,"To everyone who lost their loved ones, don&#39;t you worry, the Economy is your mother, father, Grandfather and Grandmother now! That&#39;s all they care to protect instead of their citizens."
2463,Everything will b fine soon ...please take care love from 🇮🇳 India....
2464,I lost 6 souls close to me because of this virus.<br><br>May god bless us all
2465,"We don&#39;t know when it&#39;ll be over ...<br>I thought Germany was over with the virus since there was little to no news on covid in Germany the last months, everything seemed alright ..."
2466,"People need to be responsible the world needs to fight back the pandemic 😷,,, it’s difficult but let’s face the realities ✌️"
2467,"ITS WHAT THERE NOT SAYING SAYS ALOT !More robust global governance of biosafety and biosecurity is long <br>overdue. Such a governance should include these three key areas: 1) a <br>more effective ban on offensive BW programmes, 2) much improved <br>prevention and preparation for bioterrorism, and 3) more transparent and<br> routine surveillance of biological research labs (particularly P4 and <br>P3 labs) in which scientists investigate the most dangerous pathogens <br>such as the Ebola virus and the coronavirus."
2468,"I close my fingers for great Germany.Aus Kenia ,wir sind together.."
2469,Praying for Germany<br>Take care. May god help you and solve sufferings by resolving this as soon as possible. <br>Germany is great nation with great scientist they must bring solutions fast and stop new waves.
2470,Rip to the world 🌎
2471,"The case fatality rate isn&#39;t actuate either. It&#39;s the Infection/fatality Rate that matters, and that will be less than half the CFR. The average of dozens of studies put it at 0.25 percent."
2472,"&quot;Condolences and prayers&quot;...bit overdramatic... We live a normal life, as far as possible in a pandemic.  <br>I work in an old people´s home, where all are already boostered.<br>Eastern Germany and its &quot;vaccination problem&quot; is a completely different thing..."
2473,"God bless all the people in Germany, so sad so sad."
2474,It&#39;s so sad to see this God bless everyone who dies with this deadly virus
2475,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1MYKQbgBzo&amp;t=12m29s"">12:29</a> Yes, it does make sense. Using general survival rate for predicting my change of survival is absolutely correct. It is called &quot;base rate&quot;. It doesn&#39;t mean it is exactly equal, obviously, but that&#39;s why it is called &quot;BASE&quot; rate. And It is basically used to estimate absolutely any other risk. So saying it doesn&#39;t make sense to use it it is...nonsense."
2476,"Charis,,,you have a good voice,,to,be a news reader,,,thanks for being a good news reader...."
2477,"im in the uk, i am a 36 year old single mom with 2 disabled daughters 13 and 14, we all have covid 19 and we are so unwell, this terrifies me. i have had 3 vaccines, my girls have developed other illnesses with the covid, my girls viral infections me a chest infection. i am so scared.😱😱😱"
2478,"A total of 939,520 people died in Germany in 2019, of whom 465,885 were men and 473,635 women. This means that the number of deaths has fallen by 1.6% compared to the previous year. As in the previous years, the most common cause of death in 2019 was cardiovascular disease."
2479,"It would be so easy to simultaneously prevent the unvaccinated from dying from covid, while also preventing them from spreading the virus further! It just requires their initiative, rather than inaction."
2480,🥺🥺 GOD BLESS US ALL
2481,My deepest condolences to all the German&#39;s who lost their loved ones due to COVID-19. My sympathy and prayers are all with you. God Bless.
2482,Stop allowing all those people over there. Shut the country down. Praying for her🙏🏿
2483,"I am praying for y’all. Question however, does this mean the vaccine doesn’t work?"
2484,"Let the people saw the videos from the overwhelming hospitals, overworked cemeteries/crematoriums, sights from the corpses of self-quarantine covid patients being evacuated from homes, and pile of corpses waiting to be buried/cremated from all states in Germany broadcasted nationwide to make people realised that this is not a thing they can underestimate. The sight of deaths all over the places will always existed as the most undeniable evidences when things already went horribly wrong and healthcare system no longer able to cope..."
2485,I pray to the god for providing great relief in a short life span. In really that&#39;s a crucial problem not only for the Germany but also for all over the world. So I how I express as now world is moving towards the bright future.🌹🌹✍️✍️
2486,Come on  Germany. You can do it
2487,"Also, no one seems to be talking about the fact that people aren&#39;t just dying from this, some people are getting permanent health issues from it."
2488,The people waiting in front of vaccination facilities should by sorted by age. Old people first.
2489,"Das Leben anderer Menschen liegt in unserer Verantwortung, lassen Sie uns impfen und die Gesundheitsvorschriften einhalten, ungeachtet der Freiheit in Deutschland."
2490,"Can you please report breakdown of deaths and infections by vaccinated and unvaccinated to provide more color on the situation? This could give viewers some appreciation on whether more loss of lives can be avoided, if at all. Thank you."
2491,god i wish i could live in germany. then i could be allowed to mourn like a human being
2492,Were those who were infected and those who died vaccinated? That&#39;s important.
2493,This is just tragedy
2494,"Hope you all and all my friends and their family in Germany are safe and healthy 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻<br>BE SAFE , STAY SAFE.<br>WASH YOUR HANDS FREQUENTLY WITH SOAP AND WATER."
2495,This is going to be similar like the Indian wave in Europe.
2496,We Indians really pray for you
2497,My father also died from Covid 10 months ago. I was quite disturbing to not be able to see his face for the last time. He didn&#39;t take care of his health because he didn&#39;t understand how to do it despite our support.  Due to his lifestyle I was expecting him to die as soon as he caught the virus. I warned him over and over about his risks but he just couldn&#39;t understand. We didn&#39;t have the vaccine available at that time.<br>I was never vaccinated nor got the virus and I am against mandatory vaccination.
2498,"Universal Solidarity! Disolve vaccine patents on the grounds of national security and international diplomacy - end global vaccine apartheid. Get the vaccine to non-EU countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East. Close all boarders to Air Travel including Nationals. Preserve life."
2499,Es ist was es ist<br>Respect the situation<br>Take it Seriously
2500,What about 2time and what happens when all go to the second round?🤔
2501,If the mortality rate is = to R then perhaps non vaccinated people might start taking this more seriously.
2502,Life goes on
2503,thats what happens when you restrict  early treatment options.
2504,China might be looking all this death  and smiling.... Mission successful🏆💪
2505,More people  need to get the vaccine
2506,Life is a big risk. Let people decide for themselves how to navigate it. <br><br>Fun fact: those in &quot;charge&quot; are generally really clueless.
2507,"When I saw other countries with much less deaths, I want to ask whose to blame, looks like that the government want that to happen and did nothing but talking"
2508,Has anyone checked to see if these are delta or omicron? Maybe this is actually omicron? Why the sudden surge?
2509,"We wouldn&#39;t have to face anything if the  sadists who were writhing in their shoes with the prospect of killing soooo many people and getting away with it, would&#39;ve been stopped dead in their tracks"
2510,"At began germany death numbers was low. When vaccination came, number are high."
2511,"This sounds like a Broadway drama, too much acting in a real life scenario"
2512,Om shanti to all deceased from india  🙏
2513,"Maybe the German government should address the real problem, there are not enough doctors and nurses and those there are badly paid. German youth that would like to study medicine have to leave Germany and study abroad because they are no places at the University."
2514,Why do government s still sell tobacco and its rwlated stuff?<br>...<br>And what about alcohol related deaths and illnesses and cancer ?<br>...<br>OmNicron<br>...<br>Please do not worry
2515,"The reaction to omicron is too little too late. They should have been requiring testing, masks, vaccination and quarantine for all travelers worldwide with no exemptions. Can’t, or don’t want to get vaccinated, then don’t travel."
2516,Its a lesson i guess...in a way
2517,Count also those deaths of other uncured illnesses because hospitals are full.
2518,The lack of aspirating needles before injecting is shocking
2519,"SO in other words, OBEY unless you wanna start dyig, seems very simple guidelines to follow , if they say stay home, you stay home. If they say wear a facemask, you wear a facemask. This is something you can tell to a child and if you don&#39;t obey that&#39;s on you, but don&#39;t be crying you are dying in a hospital bed."
2520,Yeah right DW. You seem to forget that your credibility as journalists is by now 0
2521,hundreds die per day.. condolences to the grief stricken
2522,Is Germany still getting new cases...I m from India...pls respond who ever have info
2523,COVID certification of vaccine identification . the games up.
2524,Has DW examined whether these are deaths from Covid or deaths with Covid.  There&#39;s a big difference between &quot;from&quot; and &quot;with&quot;.  Perhaps DW should do some extra research to examine this?
2525,"I know wearing masks aren&#39;t foolproof but what if everyone wore it everywhere? I haven&#39;t even had a cold in the last 2 years just because of wearing a mask and hand sanitizer. Oh yeah, eating fruits and vegetables more than I eat bad stuff also helps"
2526,I wonder why Germany&#39;s politician are so pig head. People go to the doctors and still no medicine has been prescribed this the the holly Grail of stubbornness
2527,Totally backwards when we know it&#39;s the vaccinated spreading it 🤣🤣🤣
2528,"it&#39;s unbearable here in Germany, repugnant, deragatory and corrupt politicians who lie in everything they say, considering to move"
2529,01.12.2021<br>Deaths: ~101.919<br>Recovered: ~4.937.700
2530,Had my booster today..Moderna. So all set for the winter omicron onslaught.
2531,Maybe make being overweight illegal
2532,"I&#39;m astounded that Germany, Austria and Switzerland have allowed this virus to get out of control 🤦‍♀️.  Their country is so full of rules, and they are not shy in prosecuting those who choose to disobey them all.  (I&#39;ve lived there for several years.)   As for &quot;society acting responsibly,&quot; you are seriously kidding me 🤷‍♀️?&quot;  So happy I live in Australia 🙏."
2533,&quot;A lie told often enough becomes the truth.&quot; - Vladimir Lenin
2534,If Germany is so bad why isn&#39;t it isolated like they are doing for South Africa- there does not seem to be any real order in what the &quot;authorities &quot; do !
2535,Nowadays one has to search for quality news.
2536,Why won&#39;t they share the number of vaccinated and unvaccinated of people in hospital and dying?
2537,"Shocking that presenters continue to try to make this about South Africa, despite evidence to the contrary."
2538,This is realy happening within this month?
2539,Can’t the engineers fix it ???
2540,Flu killed the same in the years ago...a no drama before. What is going on?
2541,"As always, we&#39;d love to include your questions in our upcoming shows! What would you like to know about the coronavirus pandemic? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23askderrick"">#askDerrick</a>"
2542,"The price tag is enough to tell you how much they really care about your health. Even in a time of a pandemic when medicine and governments have lost hope, big pharmaceutical companies try to take advantage of the situation."
2543,Are you less immune after taking a viral drug for the next infection compared to having the infection and developing a natural immunity? Does this make us dependent on the drug? <br>Or does the drug allow your immunity to be more prepared for the next infection?
2544,A real game changer for Pfizer’s shareholders.
2545,600 dollars for a treatment! I wish people who profit from this are going to find out what Karma is .
2546,"I really hope they work! I&#39;m so over this pandemic, they need to scrap the vaccines as they are ineffective"
2547,"620 euros for a five-day dose is not &quot;expensive&quot;, it&#39;s daylight robbery."
2548,Doctors have been asking pharmaceuticals for a year now to have a at home treatment as well as vaccines.  They form the pillars of dealing with the pandemic.
2549,"There is already Ivermectin, and it&#39;s dirt cheap because the patent ran out; that&#39;s why they came out with the new patented drug Paxlovid!!"
2550,I hopes so! Been devastated for this pandemic to end.
2551,Sounds so similar to a drug that was banned and was almost free..
2552,"This will most probably work with the new variant as well, because there&#39;s quite a low chance for the virus component that is being targeted by the drug to have been altered by mutations"
2553,"I&#39;m just hoping that it works against all the variants, including the new one."
2554,Yes. Always good to have more expensive options over the cheap Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquin.
2555,A number of years ago I had shingles and had infection which affected my left eye I was put on Zovirax which believe affected the soreading/multiplication of the disease..
2556,"To take a pill one needs to 1. have a pill 2. know that one has to use it.  Later, with diagnostic available as it is.... well.... well, one simply can&#39;t do home made PCR every week with any degree of certainty."
2557,The same ingredients as Ivermectin. They repackaged it so that they can sell it at a lot higher price. Ivermectin is cheap and it works.
2558,"Pills have certainly made a huge difference in Uttar Pradesh, Goa and other Indian provinces. And more recently a huge difference in Japan."
2559,Will this treatment be lifelong? Most likely because there are no cures for chronic illnesses. It&#39;s not financially beneficial.
2560,620EUR? I am sure this is for the safety and health of the people!
2561,I love how Pfizer floated out the price of Paxlovid but not the cost.
2562,"I have a 39 year old  WIA (wounded in action) son, medically retired from the Army. He has come down with COVID and has been told he is too young for anti-viral drugs. They are being reserved for older people. Some levels of government in The United States have included being non-white as criteria for giving anti-viral drugs to COIVD patients. Going to get a whole lot more awful. (Our son is 100% permanently and totally disabled.) DRS / RVN Vet."
2563,"If people would take their normal vitamins on a regular basis and take care of their health with less soda, candy and cakes i think we would have a radical different situation without all these &quot;covid&quot; treatments that has shown ridicliously poor results to a point where one needs to ask oneself, does it work at all or is it just &quot;hot-air&quot;? I believe hot-air."
2564,We should be grateful that so many people are looking out for the rich and what they need
2565,"Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if, in rich countries, we would use our money to do things like, I dunno, run PCR tests and serology tests on people getting vaccines?  <br>The data might actually be useful."
2566,Isnt this based on an already available treatment in some countries with Ivermectin?
2567,This video is ten minutes old and it&#39;s already outdated because of the Nu variant. Fingers crossed that the early concerns are unwarranted.
2568,Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if we would have had a pill like this since the beginning of the pandemic.  Oh wait it&#39;s call ivermectin and it&#39;s 6 cents a pill.
2569,Never in history has the people who were tryin to force others to do what they want been the good guy&#39;s
2570,Yes of course antiviral drugs could help like the one that numerous doctors already suggested Ivermectin antiviral drug that they have been suppressing because it’s cheap and has been around forever and now they copy it at an exorbitant cost
2571,Isn&#39;t it strange how as soon as one strain starts to disappear another one just pops up out of the blue.
2572,"$600 for a course of medication that probably costs all of $15 to make and ship anywhere in the world. Fun fact, every new drug out of the US has been made with public money or developed in public universities and sold off. Yet we pay more than anyone in the world for every prescription drug in the name of &quot;research&quot;."
2573,"If this pandemic is so serious, why are the governments dragging their feet with approvals for these pills? La La La, we&#39;ll get to it."
2574,Is this woman implying it would be over the counter? How else could we have it in our houses before we have symptoms? Very odd. <br>Curious how the efficacy varies between those vaccinated and those not.
2575,Basically he’s still researching the virus and meds.
2576,Sounds alright but what are the side effects and who will be the price regulator? Govrnments should pull together and make it available to all for free.
2577,Has anyone seen the series a billion dollar company about how the pharmaceutical company in early 90s made oxicotin?<br>Edit : I believe theres a parallel here
2578,She&#39;s my favourite DW news anchor :D
2579,sounds like a very pricey game changer
2580,Just another &quot;It would have worked if...&quot; that costs billions of $$$ to your country.
2581,"Probably that&#39;s how much Ivermectin would cost, if it was still under their patent period...<br>My mother, 92 y.o., overweight and paraplegic; was treated with Ivermectin. She&#39;s fine now. She had Covid for months..."
2582,"Nice, to my understanding it meant vaccine passport is no longer necessary."
2583,"Follow the money...Of course, we&#39;ll say there are variants so it&#39;s a great way to sell pills."
2584,I am genuinely curious. Would the unvaccinated take the new drug if they get severe Covid? Can the same reasoning of not getting vaccinated be applied to reject any newly developed drugs?
2585,Great to see Pfizer isn&#39;t making buckets of money off the backs of the suffering. Who can afford $600 per treatment
2586,Ivermectin would have ended this along time ago 🤷🏾‍♂️
2587,If billionaires owned politicians and scientists and Doctors would prescribe ivermectin a pill would be game changing
2588,Makes me think 🤔 fear is what&#39;s been sold.
2589,Yeah maybe there’s a pill but how are we going to get it doctors don’t tend to prescribe pills very often when it comes to this pandemic
2590,She was so happy announcing Covid Special.
2591,"Game changer just for Pharmaceutical cooperation, this will never end the pandemic."
2592,I&#39;ve heard that the new name for this pill is Pfizermectin.
2593,news anchor in the first world totally unaware COST of current treatments is an issue 🤦
2594,600€ is a lot cheaper than current treatment I’ve spent 300€ for a root canal and that’s about 1/3 the cost as in the USA and it’s not that important
2595,"From what I&#39;ve heard from the past months , there&#39;s also a drug named ive.. wait i forgot the name but that drug also have some antiviral properties and it&#39;s so cheap"
2596,"Give the license to Indian pharmaceutical companies, they will make it cheap"
2597,im sure there will be another variant as soon as this gets approval
2598,"So many could, so many might.<br>Let&#39;s get real ,down to earth. <br>Then we&#39;ll applaud, let&#39;s not again speculate on the future,science is not about speculation, it&#39;s about reality"
2599,For countries where at home rapid antigen tests are free such as the UK or low cost like much of Europe people who are at risk should be able to take their positive test to a pharmacy and get a course of these drugs.
2600,What if you are vaccinated? I know with flu vaccine you can&#39;t get Tamiflu if you get the flu and already vaccinated against it.
2601,&quot;We need to do some improvements on our vaccine&quot;... you think?!
2602,I really want COVID to End
2603,Thanks for DW all Team .
2604,Everybody saw that coming! So obvious!
2605,This aged just about as well as the new Omnicrom variant did
2606,600$ for 5 days dose. only rich people can afford that. i only spent 2$ on decolgen  to treat my flu.
2607,It should be free...shame how they make profit out situations like this.
2608,"Here in the Philippines, that is vey expensive and only a few people can afford it!  Governments should pay for these drugs because they are the ones who allowed it to spread in their country!"
2609,What medicine to treat for Omicron variant??
2610,As a Pfizer shareholder I approve this commercial.
2611,I’m ready to do a line of anti viral drugs to stay safe (this is a joke)
2612,"It&#39;s going to be like Winbows patch, forever patch or boost."
2613,What would be the side effects of arv&#39;s... The same as hiv arv&#39;s.. Hope not
2614,Their has to be some type of light at the tunnel it can&#39;t go on forever.
2615,The Data is not at all peer reviewed. So far they have tested it on a few dozen people and they put out the data. They also selected the participants.  Thought the study was doner correctly (double blind)
2616,Is this effective for people who are long haulers?
2617,"Hopefully the good guys, who are inventing new anti-viral medicine, will outrun the bad guys, who are paid to upgrade their killer viruses to ELIMINATE, rather then just IRRITATE."
2618,When will the COVID-19 pandemic be hopefully ended?
2619,So no. There are too many people who will not take it.
2620,Pfizer should be providing that free of charge considering the billions they’ve made on this vaccination
2621,Give formula to India we will produce for 6$ for five days.
2622,"Is an entire industry, mouthcovers, vaccines, pills, stocks. Next thing you know there could be a covid museum."
2623,What it means is life time customers..
2624,Your question should be: Is there going to be a war in the Pharmaceutical Industry?
2625,So where can you buy this?
2626,Ayurveda is the ultimate answer against pharmaceuticals
2627,This pricetag is outrageous
2628,Good news..thanks…
2629,This aged badly really quickly.
2630,This pandemic will end   nothing lasts forever
2631,There is no single measure that will lead as out but what we all need to realize is that the world is the boat
2632,"Lower prices for poorer countries but the poor in the US that paid for that drug via tax money, will die bc they cant afford it? 🤷‍♂️"
2633,God help us.
2634,I hope its the red that wakes up the masses.
2635,It&#39;s been two years? That&#39;s alot of profit for the pharmaceutical companies. <br>I&#39;m still looking for that bat. 🦇
2636,"Game changer that costs €600 and needs to be taken 8x daily? I think it&#39;s cheaper to go outside and stroll an hour daily. Eat healthy, quit smoking and drink less alcohol."
2637,We are waiting for the Decepticon variant and for Optimus Prime to defeat it
2638,600 $ for something that doesn&#39;t work<br>No thank you
2639,"SNG001,...broad spectrum antiviral its just finished its phase3 trial and waiting for results suitable for early stages of infection and it can be used via an inhaler at home,"
2640,🙏🙏🙏♥️♥️♥️
2641,"As always, we&#39;d love to include your questions in our upcoming shows! What would you like to know about the coronavirus pandemic? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23askderrick"">#askDerrick</a>"
2642,I’d like to see a report on the increase in heart issues in Germany.
2643,It is very confusing that Germany has a 67% fully vaccinated population and still the hospitalization rate is high..... What is the relevance of the vaccine if it doesn&#39;t work for countries with more than 50% fully vaccinated population?
2644,"In the same time period there have been approximately 500,000 deaths by cancer in Germany in the same time. There is a cancer epidemic in Germany right now."
2645,Good reporting as always.  Keep up the good work.  I spent the month of September in Germany and loved it.  The baked goods are so good I barely survived.
2646,You may notice that WHO criteria counts every dead who had a cough or sneeze as covid dead. These numbers do not tell the amount of actual covid deaths. It tells that people cough or sneeze increases in winter.
2647,"Question is, how breakthrough cases will further influence vaccination policy? Apparently the expiration date of the mrna vaccines is much, much shorter than big pharma projected. Again new variants are emerging. Even when local herd immunity might be reached, regional, national, or supra national infections may still occur."
2648,God shower your blessings upon Germany.
2649,We are praying for friends there. Mom only trying to help German. This is very hard situation although.
2650,We dont seem to be interested in finding out where the pandemic originated from. The news media doesnt seem interested either. What do they know that we dont know.
2651,Meanwhile in sweden we are like wait there is a pandemic going on in the world ? havent notice one bit
2652,"As I am watching this both of my children are infected with covid-19. My 4 year old has had a fever for the 6th day, my 2 year old on the other hand had no symptoms at all other than a mild runny nose and a rash. Thankfully my wife and I are still testing negative after taking care of our kids all this time  (the Moderna vaccine we received months ago seems to be still working). I hope this pandemic will be over soon."
2653,So sad!   I love Germany 🇩🇪 and it’s people.   Please do all you can to be safe.
2654,"Winter in Germany is absolutley gorgeous.<br><br>As if you can&#39;t carry it from one place to another 🤷‍♀️.  Humans are  very rebellious by nature, they don&#39;t want no one telling us what to do, even at our or our loved ones expense."
2655,Stay strong and protect yourself germany
2656,LOVE YOU ALL GERMAN PEOPLE STAND UP FOR YOUR RIGHT. ❤⚘
2657,"&quot;These rights may only be interfered with on the basis of a law.&quot; That is the key sentence, and I don&#39;t how you can read that out and just ignore that part. Of course you can&#39;t just violate someone&#39;s personal freedom without a basis in law. But we do allow interference in those things when society agrees there is a need and enacts a law. As we often say over here: *DUH*."
2658,"Experts?  Names, please.  100,000? Where, how, who, when did they get that figure?"
2659,Does Germany recognize natural immunity?  Or just jab immunity?
2660,I&#39;m perfectly fine with people making their own choices.
2661,Sir  gd day I&#39;d just want  to ask an information  from you about covid death is about 2 years from now since the covif broke out do you have a  study data that those who died in covid are no underlying disease like advance cancer diabetest etc so that the people are aware for their lives tanx.
2662,"Are the unvaccinated also hesitant to get tested? If so, how accurate are the numbers of daily cases?"
2663,"When we disrespect our elders today, how much will we be respected when become elderly?"
2664,"God bless Germany, I am sorry to hear of the covid-19 deaths.<br>It&#39;s on the rise in Kentucky U.S. too."
2665,Only channel I found willing to introspect. Kudos DW.
2666,🙏🙏🙏 hope everything become normal in Germany
2667,The more the force people the more people will refuse. Many thinks it&#39;s a bio-weapon and some think it&#39;s to save and protect them.  I think it&#39;s up to the individual to make that decision and nobody else.
2668,I knew it ..the people they are showing us lining for there vaccination are the same people just completing there 2nd or 3rd or 4th vaccination ...🤝
2669,"it is tragic though, that germany has been so cautious and respecting of individual freedoms before calling for lockdowns that so many people still died anyway"
2670,It&#39;s funny to watch adults covering their stupidity by twisting words.
2671,The hospitals in Europe and in most western countries were broken before the pandemic. Do recovers need to get vaccinated?
2672,Alot of countries in Asia follow guidelines and are mostly free of covid. Life is almost normal.
2673,God please bless Germany.....🤕
2674,If you take action- people complain. If you dont take any action- people complain. :-)
2675,Every &quot;expert&quot; steering this maniacal runaway train must testify under oath about this pandemic to justify the actions that are being taken across the world
2676,"83.25 million divided by 100 thousand is 832.  One in 832 is .12 as decimal, or 12/100 of one percent.<br>This doesn&#39;t meet the definition of pandemic. I still don&#39;t buy it."
2677,Some one grew tall because he had complon and some became fair after using Fair &amp; Lovely there were a few who got burnt as they had sun bath and then there was this hundred thousand who died because they were not vaccinated.
2678,&quot;Increases in COVID-19 are unrelated to levels of vaccination across 68 countries and 2947 counties in the United States&quot;<br>A study to look up.
2679,"Yes, the nocebo effect should also be considered."
2680,People should have the right to choose as long as they are aware that they are also choosing they could lose their life for choosing not to be vaccinated
2681,Only wish the best for the German peeps 👍
2682,The vaccine may work for a short time but the side effect is there. It can be minor or bad for someone.
2683,"I would think Katrin&#39;s logic has failed. If 35% are not vaccinated 9 months after access, then they wont. Mandating it cannot NOT go backwards. from the 65%. I think the world should adopt a number of measures used by different countries. People have rights not to be vaccinated, but it is not the majorities role to ensure that they receive healthcare ahead of others. Singapore charges not vaccinated treatment while others suggest they should elect to ride their illness at home. I don&#39;t see why people who need life saving cardiac surgery or others need to have their lives risked by those that ignore the good of society."
2684,What i hear from this news: they will mandate it at some point in near future.
2685,When science goes unchecked. This happens. Mad chaos.
2686,"Lady,,excellent news reader and clear reader you are,,,,like your voice,,,,thanks for being a good news reader."

2688,We all know what happened the last time Germany followed an Austrian 🤷
2689,So incredibly sad and worrying for the rest of winter ahead. Worried Germany&#39;s efficent healthcare system will be tested to the limit before this is over.... it seem that&#39;s happening at the moment.
2690,"Sad to german,hope germany can be fine ."
2691,What is the data on people that have gotten Covid  and the percentage of them that get it again?<br>What are the numbers of breakthrough  cases of people that are fully vaccinated BEFORE the booster?<br>What are the numbers of people that have long term side effects from the vaccines?
2692,Was that due to covid or with covid?
2693,The guest makes a salient point. Knowing what we all know now we can not expect others to die so we can avoid getting an owie  mommy! A shot in the arm.
2694,"The Lost Man Parable<br><br>A man having lost his way while returning home found himself in a dangerous situation where the surrounding were full of wild ferocious beast and poisonous snakes . By chance he met a Wise man who knows how to deal with these dangerous animals and poisonous snakes.<br><br>The wise man asked &quot;Poor fellow, do you know you are in the midst of ferocious beast and poisonous snakes ? Why do you come this way? Do you have any means to deal with this ferocious beast and poisonous snakes ?&quot;<br><br>Upon hearing this, the man realized his dangerous situation and asked for help. The Wise man than caught hold of his hand and guide him out of this dangerous situation to safety. The Wise man then said &quot;Be wise now and do not tread this Path again.

2699,No way 😲 what&#39;s going on what happened ?
2700,What I read is &quot;15 million people exercise their freedom&quot;
2701,Same in my state. I just don&#39;t get it. My son worked in the food industry the whole pandemic. He got the vaccine and the booster all moderna. He never got sick so far. I cannot say the same for his coworkers.
2702,What percentage of the deaths attributed to covid 19 had been vaccinated?
2703,I remember my childhood. When I use to act stubborn when my mom forced me to eat food. And when she stopped forcing me. I had food on my own.
2704,Those vaccines worked like a charm.
2705,And how many died in previous years from flu?
2706,Excellent !!! It is not a vaccine!! Keep fighting!!!
2707,Very Sad and heartbreaking NEWS.

2723,"What hospital is almost collapsing because of the extrem number of sick people? I want to go see it by myself and go to help. Where is the Epidemie? In what city? Check my neighbours, they must be natural immune because no one over the last years got infected or sick"

But there is a much larger group that shows various degrees of reluctance, but might be persuaded. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s fundamentally similar in Germany. If you start trying to force it, that hard-core resistance group may grow considerably. Soweit geht das leben, I think is the German phrase. That&#39;s life."

2742,"It is not correct to suggest that a high vaccination uptake will bring about herd immunity . we were all sold that yarn last year , but here in Ireland we have 93% of the population fully vaccinated yet infections are soaring and hospital admissions rising ."
2743,Politicians in Bavaria: its an emergency situation and we will definitely need some kind of lockdown.  But let&#39;s not yet cancel the Christmas markets. Let&#39;s wait a couple more days until the markets are build up and prepared. Then we can cancel it.
2744,I&#39;m so ashamed of my country right now
2745,For the first time in history the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who refuse to take it.
2746,"We have reached herd immunity in NSW and ACT in Australia, lockdown here is over. Victoria is trailing behind but they are a special case as they have had trouble containing the virus throughout the pandemic. The rest of the country have had virtually no outbreaks.<br>Japan is another country that has done well."
2747,I guess Germany can ask Gibraltar how herd immunity is going. SMH
2748,Good report thanks DW
2749,"Why were open air Christmas markets closed, including markets that could keep 3G or 2G and yet restaurants and other indoor businesses remain open? This makes no sense. Not to mention the psychological aspect of closing Christmas markets. If a business can keep 2G or 3G, whatever the current rule is, let it stay open!"
2750,So... it&#39;s the same in France and the UK then? As they vaccinated only slightly more than Germany. Overall very similar number. Around 67-69% fully vaccinated.
2751,"I vividly remember the bashing of foreign media on India at India&#39;s second wave. We have done a billion dose afterward, pretty impressive for a poor country. Learn from ur mistakes, and you will never face problems again."
2752,"6 months from now, will those who went through this coming wave be a bit more respectful towards various messages for for adequate ventilation, distancing and also the use of high quality masks--for indoors especially; and also outdoor pursuits with greater emphasis on distancing and wearing comfortable enough outdoor clothing?"
2753,That&#39;s good. Another good idea is to follow Singapore&#39;s implementation of paying the medical bill when ventilation and care is required for non vaxxers who get severe covid.
2754,During the first 2 waves of Covid-19 Germany was an example for other countires in protecting its people.<br>What went wrong?
2755,When selfishness and misinformation makes an &quot;advanced&quot; country look like a 3rd world country.
2756,"More ICU facilities could have been constructed since the pandemic began you know. Governments knew how important they are, and yes preventing rising infections must be a priority. But every nation must be prepared for the worst."
2757,A country that&#39;s clean and well planned will be safe in general.
2758,Germany historically was notorious for not being prepared for the winter.
2759,I never thought I would see Germany without any leadership.
2760,People will get Infected and that will also bring us back to a normal life though. It is just a lot more stressful that way.

2762,"In East Asia, there&#39;s an antiviral substance found 20+ years ago, exist in few species of brown seaweed, called Fucoidan, its extract is listed as foid in all countries, no prescription or permission needed to use, and won&#39;t interfere with other treatments."
2763,I have a friend in the UK who hasn&#39;t got her shot &quot;Because they never called me&quot; and made it into a personal nobody cares about me story. But haven&#39;t they got to the point now where you can make appointments or find a walk-in clinic and try to get in line? I have a feeling that a lot of people who are still unvaccinated are the kind who have a hard time deviating from their routine and just never get around to it. What is the strategy for reaching those people? I&#39;m guessing this is why they are focusing on the help of family doctors and family members to encourage people to get a shot.
2764,"We are all light years from normality, even countries that are doing well are too. We cannot return to normal. Normal wasn&#39;t working. We&#39;ll have to come up with a new normal and we&#39;ve been doing that for the past century and a half (and longer) after a global crisis."
2765,&quot;The country has never reached herd immunity&quot; Is DW implying that other countries have ?
2766,Don&#39;t forget ro wear mask when you go out and still observe social distancing even you are fully vaccinated.
2767,"We should speed up the verification of intranasal vaccine. This is the only hope left to end the pandemic. I don&#39;t know why it is so slow. The AZ, BNT and Moderna were used only after one year. AZ can also be used as intranasal vaccine. Please, hurry up. People are dying every day."
2768,Maybe ask Japan for advice on how to reduce infections.
2769,You all have it so good over there with quality vaccine enough for everyone yet some refused to get it lol<br>Here we don&#39;t have enough quality vaccine while almost everyone want to get vaccinated.
2770,Light years is a measurement of distance not time.. 🙄

We still wear mask unless in a restaurant but we are having 20k stadium basketball or football games and there’s no mass infection events anymore. So yah vax thankfully has worked. We still have infections but at least people are not being admitted to the hospital in vast numbers where we can’t book appointments for regular care due to overwhelming number of Covid cases. To me I feel good that my older parents can seek help in the hospital now without the fear they can’t be admitted if the infections were the same level as it was in December 2020."
2787,"Yeah just unnecessarily take a hospital bed from some one else who needs it who is not at fault for their ICU needs.  Enjoy the likely lab altered pathogen when you eventually get it. No choice, you will get it at some point."

2813,"i read about germany and hear english speaking ireland, baffling"
2814,Vaccination has very little to do with it. Herd immunity won&#39;t happen even if 100% were fully vaccinated.
2815,Gibraltar has 100% vaccination rate but Covid is on the rise there. Any explanations?
2816,I just imagine...<br>If someone have something that really works against the virus...<br>What will happen?

2820,For the sake of His sorrowful Passion have mercy on us and on the whole world.
2821,A new weekly statistic information should be made public  of how many non vaccinated people die. Such information would convince people to make the right decision.

Have it on my forearm some kind of roughnes. 3 diffrent Ointments with antibiotic didn&#39;t helped. After first use of vinegar it was diffrence. And removed fully in few use. Annua artemisia helped in problems after tooth removal. Taked 2 antibiotics and nothing changed. After half year i get it Annua. After one week it was like nothing happened. Bee pollen it is like some booster. Vaporization remove nearly every thing from respiratory system. In times of infections use bee juice with garlic, onion and lemon. After 2 weeks of use mixture, i am changing for Bee Pollen. Maybe there are some other solutions ??"

2829,I wish this dummy wld not interrupt him 😒 🙄 so rude
2830,This question has no solution.
2831,Herd immunity is not seen in countries with a vaccination rate of 90%. Herd immunity must be taken out the studies on virology.
2832,Light year is not a unit of time but that of distance. It is the distance light travels in free space in a year.

2849,I wish all of the doctors and medical staffs have enough motivation and energy to cope with the emergency situation in Germany.
2850,"Stay strong, Germany!"
2851,Sending love and prayers to germany most specially the health workers 😇
2852,We would be nowhere without these wonderful medical people! Thank you so much!!!
2853,God bless all medical staff all over the world during this pandemic. They are selfless and giving their all for patients.
2854,"These doctors, medical workers should be given compensation for the hard work and extreme stress they are taking."
2855,"Stay strong and bold, Germany! We think about you."
2856,These doctors and nurses are heroes. &lt;3
2857,"Dear doctors and all frontlines, appreciate your efforts. Stay safe and healthy. Regards 🙏🏼"
2858,My Prayers go out to all the Doctors and nurses 🙏 fighting Covid and other medical needs in Hospitals all around the World 🌎!!!
2859,"This was a problem in other countries. <br>1) in order to provide quality health services i.e. not quantity, hospitals only accept number of people they can handle <br>2) those not accepted are put on waiting list. Health care provided at home.<br>3) priority given to younger patients because of shorter confinement periods <br>4) local govt can also set up extra beds to give IVs to patients with mild syndromes. Most cases these patients will not need hospitalization after getting IV."
2860,Please support healthcare workers by being socially responsible. Take adequate precautions. Get immunized.
2861,"Pray to Germany, as Indonesian we ever feel how bad covid19 in the second wave. Stay strong and keep safe. Hope get well soon. 💖🇮🇩🇩🇪"
2862,<i>Stay strong Germany...Every cloud has a silver lining...</i> 🙏
2863,"Germany you can get through with this pandemic, you are strong"
2864,Salute to healthcare worker&#39;s in Germany :-)
2865,Respect for the nurses and the doctors. They work for our safety day and night. They give their best even though they are mostly over loaded. Why just don&#39;t follow the same patern as the sweedish model? Live and let live.
2866,"Don&#39;t know how many more months doctors  nurses have to bear this? They are tired  physically and mentally ...they need rest , they want time to spend with family.  They need their space.  They are crying , they are totally exhausted....God help them   , give them strength to face these tough situation....."

2870,Stay strong Germany 🇩🇪
2871,"I have a relative in a US coronavirus ward in a trama center (collects the most sick patients) and friends doctors in ERs and other coronavirus wards.  It is awful when then have to decide who can get a treatment (triage).  Triage is good when &quot;you have priority for this care,&quot; it is not good when they decide who goes to the ICU.  Right now, it is a 4 tier system:<br>1.  Patients sent home from the ER with oxygen and pills to treat themselves who would have been hospitalized a few months ago.<br>2.  Patients who can only get care in a normally staffed floor (1/2 staffing of a critical care ward during the day, 1/4 at night).  Which they are augmenting the staff, there is little they can do.  Several nurses had to leave even when patients desperately need them.  They are that exhausted.<br>3.  Patients who get into the coronavirus ward, staffed as a critical care ward.  Extra doctors for kidney, lung, and other care that are often complications of coronavirus.<br>4.  A tiny number of patients, 12 of 70, who get the ICU bet.  Very high staffing (double a critical care ward) and the only place they can put patients on respirators.  <br><br>There is another level, ECMO, the machines that pump oxygen, but very few hospitals have those machines and staffing as that requires double the staffing per patient of an ICU.  <br><br>I had an uncle sent home as he was expected to fill the hospital bed for 7 weeks, while they could turn younger patients in 3 days with Randomiser.   He was expected to die.  Instead the family stepped up and nursed him to health.  <br><br>If only there was a medicine that reduced transmission, the risk of getting sick, and markedly reduced the chance of being hospitalized..."
2872,Praying for Germany 🙏🏽
2873,"Praying for the nurses and doctors and staff support . May God grant his strength and protection, hope and faith  for weary hearts and bodies"
2874,Thank you to all the care givers!
2875,"Stay strong Germany, my heart is with you.  Love from Thailand.💪"
2876,"Here in Taiwan, we have had no new community cases for over 2 weeks as of today (Nov. 24, 2021), mostly because people know they have to wear masks to protect themselves and the ones they love."
2877,And Netherlands is moving patients to Germany. <br>Thank you German medical staff 🙏🏻
2878,The death no is very low  in Germany.<br>But the case load is so large and the health fraternity is bearing the brunt of the whole epidemic.<br>Stay strong Germany.
2879,My hat is off to nurse Sandra Reimann!  Respect!  The caregivers that care for those that are too blind to be COVID vaccinated must be admired. They work so hard to save those that did nothing to save themselves. Respect.
2880,"Hang in there doctors, nurses and hospital staff. Take care of yourself too."
2881,"Just seeing doctors in hospitals is triggering. Even though I don&#39;t work in ICU, had to deal with delayed treatment, worse outcomes and increased deaths in my patients due to corona. It took a toll on me. That&#39;s why I am taking a long time away from the hospital. Taxing..."
2882,Stay strong Germany .u shall sail out of this situation
2883,"All of us must do our part. If you are sick with fever and cough, get yourself tested and stop going out to  spread your sickness."
2884,I pray 🙏 for Germany 🇩🇪 and the world fight for this virus 🦠
2885,"I gave up after 1 year of taking care of covid patients and having to balance that with looking after non covid patients. Day and night, broke down mentally amd physically. I admire those who have stuck on to the good work"
2886,If nurses say they are exhaused it must be so. Wish you all safe and sound. God bless you.
2887,Stay strong Germany !
2888,"Lots of questions and skepticism about numbers in Africa and Asia. Let me give the African perspective:<br>1. Younger population. Median age in Kenya is like twenty years. So, clearly, this is a major factor coz Covid-19 is less fatal to younger people.<br>2. Healthier lifestyles in terms of low obesity, cleaner air, fresh food, e.t.c <br>The two issues to take care of most of the mitigating factors for serious covid-19.<br>3. There were poorly enforced social distancing rules. Thanks to corruption and other issues, lockdowns were not as strict as Asia or Europe. Therefore, if there is something like heard immunity, we got it and continue to enjoy it because of the social structures. <br>With a younger, healthier population, then covid becomes less of a problem, which would be improved with some higher herd immunity, before the vaccines came.<br>4. There have been some comments thst Africans have some sort of immunity because most of us have suffered high fevers coz of Malaria. I dont know the truth behind this, it could even have bern given as an insult. However, it is common enough that I will not shy from explaining it away. Most Kenyans have had malaria at one time. I’ve had it twice, it is like death of the joints and the stomach. Covid is about breathing, but I guess I know what those fevers are like, not sure if there is immunity for this, but I will leave it here for those who wasn’t to take a swipe at it. <br>5. The issue was not politicized. We have suffered many a pandemics and things like the measles and polio, HIV/AIDS and others are still fresh in our minds, and we know how these things work. Medical ‘miracles’ has not become a right or guarantee that we take if for granted. So, we wear masks, mask our kids who went to school well and try to comply where we can (afford) to. <br>6. Some are saying deaths are unreported. Where? How? If nothing else, trust the NGOs who come here to exploit us for funding and the media to go all out saying Africa is ending coz of Covid19. If you dont trust Africans, trust big pharma to use that do thst they can get funds and donations to bring meds. So, no deaths as such.<br>.. in other words, think of Africa as your country but only if the old people were less than90% and the obesity was less than 90% and the air was cleaner without factories and pollutants, no central air/artificial air that circulates  the same air, and the weather warm - where covid19 is less serious in the summers there - and you can see how and why things are back to normal over here. <br>I am very Sorry for what Germany is going through. Wish you the best."
2889,India suffered the same. We hope you recover from this soon.
2890,"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAM6kaOzCXM&amp;t=6m09s"">6:09</a> Katherine M. is really showing her empathy.  Her hair is swept over to the left protecting her sensitive side while exposing her pragmatic right side showing she is serious about the point she is making.  ... front line staff need support.   ..at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAM6kaOzCXM&amp;t=7m26s"">7:26</a> she pulls her hair back and is more analytical in her comments...  she wanted to make it point. I wish two things one that the airhead presenter could have let Katherine finish her comment and that I could give Katherine a real bear hug other than the virtual one I am sending her now. You docs are fighting the good fight. From one frontline worker to another FRONTLINE STRONG!  Stay well."
2891,Good luck Europe. Love from Australia.
2892,"I really appreciate the healthcare staff. I know that doesn’t pay your bills and doesn’t take any burden off your work, but I really mean it. If I had the possibility, i would take the responsibility to increase your wages."
2893,Prayers for Germany. My future country

2905,Stay strong Germany 🇩🇪.
2906,I know it&#39;s a tough time for Germany and whole world thanks to the owner
2907,"The statics on Germany from start of COVID in 2020 to May 2021 show between 2 and 3 percent deaths per case. However, since June 2021, the death percentages have dropped below 0.5 percent of cases. This is clearly an indication of success, not of failure.  What has changed? Is the current variant weaker? Are the medical systems better?"
2908,Força Germany. 💪🇩🇪🇧🇷
2909,Prayers for Germany.. keep safe Gabi.
2910,India had the same situation last March till May 🙁
2911,"Keep teaching, be totally  transparent with everything not censoring others of opposing facts, mandates and and using other as scapegoat is where it all went wrong sadly god blessed the nurse 👨‍⚕️ and other who continues to spread facts and not misinformation. 😞"
2912,Stay strong Germany doctors . Nures . Staffs and frontlines and all the people safely and getting better

2921,"We cannot be lenient about this pandemic no matter who we are we are still not free of this covid, be strong germany"
2922,This means any country(1st or 3rd world) can get to this state. Sad to see Germany is facing what India went through. We here Malaysia went through this too. We all compulsory mask wearing and avoid crowding still. Hope everyone there just postpone outdoor activity for a while. Pity the frontliners please.
2923,Fratelli tedeschi forza e  coraggio l’Italia vi è vicina 👊
2924,God bless all those patients doctors and nurses in Germany. As a matter of fact I send my blessing to everyone in Germany. Its scary here in the UK as well as our government will only act when it&#39;s to late. They are to busy finding ways to fill their own pockets with money.
2925,Whether Germany and other European countries get through this pandemic depends on how many do they prepare to sacrifice  and how people cooperate with society.
2926,I would like to work in Germany.
2927,Why European high income countries like Germany and Netherlands is struggling with Covid 19 European countries have advance medical systems compared to Asia or Africa but Asia and Africa has fewer cases and deaths compared to Developed countries in Europe? It&#39;s Questionable..
2928,Welcome in the new era off the great Germany!
2929,What treatment protocols are being followed in details?   Discuss the medications that are being used to give the patients.
2930,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAM6kaOzCXM&amp;t=8m50s"">8:50</a> just let her speak... she gives so much interesting valuable information."
2931,stay strong germany the land of humanism
2932,Stay strong Germany. This way you will reach to herd immunity but with hard way. India faces the same in April. Pray to God ultimately he will cure you all.
2933,"Come on Germany , you have to fight this"
2934,"Stay Strong, Germany. Sending you love from The Philippines. 🙏❤️🇩🇪🇵🇭"
2935,The hospital ward shown looked remarkably calm and not overflowing with coronavirus patients. How odd. 😒
2936,Unvaccinated. <br>That is indeed a state of the art hospital.
2937,Germany stay safe!!! Even our country has been in a situation like this couple of months ago.....but everything will be fine!! Never loose hope!! Hopefully people actually follow the lock down rules as much as they can.....this way they can save thousands of lives and also themselves!! <br><br>Senden Sie jede Menge Liebe und Unterstützung aus Indien.💗💗..
2938,Same thing everywhere. Lack of hospitals. Should people have a hospital in case they need?
2939,"It has to be taken seriously, but I think one should also be careful not to exaggerate things. Compared to last winter, the number of covid patients in the hospitals is still significantly lower (but rising, I know), and last year there was no need for triage. So while Germany has to be careful, they&#39;re still far away from how it was in other countries. They have gotten through this better than most other places so far and I think they will avoid a collapse this time around, too."
2940,Triage.. must be the nightmare of medical staff.. i feel for them :(
2941,"As always, we&#39;d love to include your questions in our upcoming shows! What would you like to know about the coronavirus pandemic? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23askderrick"">#askDerrick</a>"
2942,"No matter how many people are vaccinated, there will always be a reason or excuse why more booster shots are needed!"
2943,"In the case of the US private health system, any pressure to get vaccinated would come <br>from the insurance companies raising rates on higher-risk customers, including the un-vaccinated."
2944,"If the state forces people to have vaccines then the state must be held legally responsible for any harm caused. Drug companies must also be held accountable for any, misleading, withheld or falsified data they use to justify the vaccine safety."
2945,In most developed countries (minus US as they effectively function like that on daily basis) this will not work simply because the costs of spending a few weeks in ICU is very high and might be liquidating for many - what would just cause possibly even larger problem for the social system. So I don’t really expect to see this being implemented anywhere in such an extreme way.
2946,"Every day I&#39;m upset about the USA health care system. Hearing another country essentially going, &quot;we&#39;ll make you pay for your own care--! --maybe. That would be too cruel. We&#39;ll still have safety nets, maybe just sticker shock, the threat, would help curb the spread. I&#39;m not sure if the law would let us be so inhumane.&quot; I just stare harder at the USA healthcare system with fire in my eyes."
2947,"Relative to Singapore charging for treatment in hospital, will/do the unvaccinated also have legitimate access to the full range of possible outpatient treatments (I-MASK+ protocol is one example, but there are others such as Zelenko protocol)?   If those ‘low cost outpatient preventative and early treatment protocols are fully available in Singapore, to what extent is the public health messaging spreading the word about these low cost treatments in order to reduce the in-hospital expensive treatments. If I were an unvaccinated resident I would certainly want to reduce my risk of severe infection and severe expense through use of inexpensive preventative and early treatment options."
2948,"I would like to know the exact numbers of people (not percentages) who have COVID in Singapore who have been vaccinated and those who haven&#39;t been. Then, I&#39;d like to know the exact number of people who are spending multiple nights in the hospital due to COVID who have been vaccinated and of those who have not been. This kind of transparency will help to fight the pandemic. Thank you."
2949,This is what we need to do
2950,"Bullies, people right choose if they want to take drugs or not...this is evil...hopefully people do stand for their rights and not be bullied into it. People power."
2951,"If you need to know your future health status of your country don’t ask the doctors, ask the politicians… they can tell you."
2952,No problem - just give me back all of my tax dollars.
2953,DW Singapore do not have a hospital called National Hospital of Singapore. Please kindly verify with the man you are interviewing.  There is a National University Hospital. Another is the Singapore General Hospital which is the national hospital of Singapore.
2954,People what eat sugar should also pay diabetic treatment?
2955,"Thanks to you all for your testimonies, it has helped me greatly i thought they were not real but I will now boldly testify...... her strategies is awesome"
2956,"Do they provide the possibility of vaccination with Novavax? Big question! To persons like me who had 2 months side effects, or my daughter who will only take protein, is not about anti vac!"
2957,"The protected need to be protected from the unprotected, by forcing the unprotected to use the protection that didn’t protect the protected."
2958,Understand that there will be medical bill subsidies for Singaporeans based on their income earnings. This policy is to make people feel the pinch to come up with the money even though the amount is not substantial.
2959,"I see a lot of similarity how Singapore and China introduced the restrictive measures against anti-vaxxers to smother them. Non-compliant means no life without job, benefits and standard lifestyle (shopping, dining...etc). Government in many countries started ignoring people in 2021. I feel worse for 2022."
2960,"This topic is a good topic of discussion.   Making the unvaccinated pay for their treatments.     In a way, I agree that when there is a treatment for a person getting sick or hospitalized, and the treatment was free, yet people choose to not do it, but then get sick and require hospitalization, then the person SHOULD have to pay for the medical treatment they receive.   People need to take some personal responsibility for their decisions."
2961,The protected need to be protected from the unprotected by forcing the unprotected to get the protection that does not protect the protected?
2962,It costs 4 million gbp to prevent 50 hospitalisations in my age group 50 to 59. I have done the math based on cost of vaccines etc. Let the vaccinated pay for their vaccine and we will pay our hospital bills.
2963,"For the healthy people they must be vaccinated while those w/ health issues a Medical Certificate must be secured. So, this is for their own safety."
2964,"DW explains the summary of Covid health care conditions, asks the Infectious specialist in Singapore a question on How Much does it cost to be in ICU in Singapore. Answers the same summary DW just explain before the interview 🤦🤦🤦"
2965,I would have supported their decision.. but the third dose of vaccine is really making me sceptical about the effectiveness of the vaccine
2966,"Every insurance policy has a section that says something to the effect that the insured must take reasonable measures to mitigate loss, or the claim will not be paid. That&#39;s in every single insurance policy. Like if a fire starts in my kitchen and I just walk away and do nothing, then they won&#39;t pay the claim for that fire. I would have to at least call 911 or try to use a fire extinguisher or something. If they find out that I did nothing, the claim will be denied."
2967,"Will this be applied for those who travel, too?"
2968,What happens when the unvaccinated start objecting to paying for services they don&#39;t get?
2969,"Well it speak the truth, however one should hold responsibility for their own health and social responsibility aswell. Given that vaccination provided for and any tailspin after the vaccination, healthcare will be provided for. Every country plans their road map to open their borders and pandemic becomes endemic. But the unknown rather if the booster  jab will be the answer or it becomes a yearly affair."
2970,Way to go Singapore. Great idea. They had the chance to receive a free covid vaccination.
2971,"A great Idea, patients will be able to chose a prophylactic of their choice, if they are paying for it... <br>Also will the un-vaccinated receive tax rebates?"
2972,Let me educate this Germany news! Beside Singapore making unvaccinated to pay as of 1 Jan 2022 those unvaccinated is unable to enter workplaces etc in Singapore
2973,Fair policy. Not necessary to swing to extreme  measures like making only certain vaccines available. People values freedom and make their own reasonable choices. Both sides who disagree need to compromise and find a middle way which are bearable for both parties.
2974,So I understand that sick vaccinated will pay the same and in addition they will cover their treatment of severe side effects. After all that are signing a paper that they do this on their own risk.
2975,Very good 👍🏻 all unvaccinated people should pay for the pandemic consequences
2976,&quot;A sizable majority of the covid patients&quot;.  What an elegant and plain way of putting it!
2977,"yes sir,of course sir,you are right sir, have a nice day sir,but you are toooo close to China sir, so this rules are normal for you sir, oh sir they said also that the vaccinated people can also infect other people with corona virus sir, not in your region...?"
2978,Statistics are fun. We still use the phrase&quot;eligible population&quot; when talking about vaccines. Does a virus care if you were eligible. A percentage only matters if it is evenly distributed accross the country. Who cares if 80% of the eligible population is vaccinated if half the people in a bar are not.
2979,Now there’s this new covid variant. So how will the current batches of vaccines’ standing to this new development. So what is the position of the unvaccinated now?
2980,There is a callous role from WHO ..it is the role of WHO to make the clarity and avoid confusion ...the crux is no vaccine is faster enough to the changes of version of covid ..people will go on getting jabs after jabs but end result is vulnerability will remain undaunted ..
2981,Fun fact: in the U$ they do it for all
2982,"Why stop at COVID? Overweight people should pay for related diseases, smokers should pay for related cancer treatments,  alcoholics should pay for liver diseases."
2983,"fun fact in singapoee over 83% of the cases in hospital are old, retired and fully vaccinated - so what this barbaric rule will do is just make more people suffer proverty, those people get into intensive care are all retired anyways, singaporean retirement cash is below 300 euro"
2984,Did I miss something? Why would anyone NOT pay for their own covid treatment?
2985,"I think indonesia still need to do the same,a lot of people relying on government when they get covid but dont want to be vaccinated"
2986,"@Jason Pike<br>You are comparing 3 different things: <br>1- No using mask or not get vaccinated by covid is stubbornness and personal choice triggers by wrong information &amp; distrust in science &amp; governments. <br>2- Smoking is addictive and big cigarette companies make it that way to get profit. They should pay for sick people treatment.<br>3- Obesity is caused by so many factors including bad components in cheap food, bad eating habits, governments giving license to neglect food producers, wrong personal choices, lack of exercise and places or spaces for people to do so, genetic is involved in this too, cultural/belief/tradition and countries ideas about food and body beauty, depression &amp; other sickness can cause obesity too, etc.  <br>In conclusion, obesity is not a singularity however it could be a personal choice or not. depend of each case and the background of each situation."
2987,"Oh? That can be an option! If I pay for my treatment. But what if my infection was passed from a vaccinated? You should pay me, right? Because I was all fine, then a vaccinated passed it to me, that’s why I got sick!"
2988,"What is the %of ppl dying from heart diseases, smoking related diseases, alcohol related diseases, drugs related diseases, cancer. When Singapore can put % of the above  ppl dying, compare that figure to ppl during of unvaxxed ppl. It is the vaxxed ppl that are dying and more to come once the boosters take control of their immune systems."
2989,"How you taught other for social distancing if in your country many Houses, especially for the poor people, do not have even a 1 centimeter &quot;distance&quot;"
2990,Will Smokers pay for smoking related illnesses? Alcoholics pay for alcohol related illnesses? How about overweight people pay for illness. Will diabetics pay for themselves if they eat candy? This doesn’t make sense
2991,In AT even the tests are free -&gt;25% unvacced and they prefere to go testing instead of getting the jab
2992,"Until the ingredient list is made publicly available so you can make an informed decision on what&#39;s going into your body you shouldn&#39;t be penalized for being hesitant to taking a shot. Typical policy maker response to free will.<br><br>Edit: Concentration of ingredients (aka the formula) is what I meant. That&#39;s what I get for speed typing a comment.<br><br>The ingredients matter a bit less than the concentration of the ingredients, especially for ones that are only harmless in smaller quantities."
2993,Not geting the bloody shot is not breaking the rules..... Dw tell you&#39;re reporter that he made a mistake....
2994,Stay strong and fight coronavirus. Rock on ❤️☮️💙
2995,"My question is, if the covid vaccines are not effective stopping the spread of the virus why are they made mandatory?"
2996,does the unvaccinated have the option not to pay tax? if singapore can guarantee that the mrna vaccine doesnt have long term severe adverse side effect then its no problem.
2997,"Amazing , They should do the same in Canada , Cant have it both ways ."
2998,What if an unvaccinated hospital patient caught Covid from a vaccinated person? Would be rather an interesting bedside conversation if two vax/unvax were side-by-side in hospital beds.
2999,"The government doesn&#39;t pay for healthcare, the tax payers do.  Hey, if your not getting you&#39;re healthcare paid for, don&#39;t tax them, it should go both ways."
3000,"Everyone pays for hospital care with their taxes, even pensioners pay GST."
3001,"This is fine, if people are given a choice of doctors with a variety of treatments. Also should do the same for diseases which are commonly caused by smoking, alcohol consumption , etc"
3002,"I just don&#39;t understand why the only bet on this horse/ it&#39;s only a year old/ why not give it a year for the doubters/ just one winter of 22 to see if it holds up, without issues and see where we are at in Sept 22"
3003,"Not all vaccinated get mild disease. Unfortunately the percentage of vaccinated getting strong symptoms, increases."
3004,"Here in America: we just make everyone pay. My friends ma died and she was charged 230,000 usd for the medical bill"
3005,Interesting idea! Appears to make sense.
3006,How is it that the homeless population throughout Western Civ is quite obviously unfazed by covid?<br><br>Anyone?
3007,All I can say is what goes around comes around
3008,We are living in a world were billionaires go to space during a pandemic but we are hating on poor people who chose not to take a medication they don’t trust and claiming that as it’s their choice they should just die. How about people who choose to smoke and overeat? Why should “we” pay for their cancer treatments and heart surgeries??
3009,"DW can I have your attention please? It&#39;s important!<br>People cannot understand the difference between vaccinated vs unvaccinated in ICUs. For someone who knows basic math it&#39;s simple but it seems there is a general incompetence that needs to be addressed. Show statistics please from countries, not just the percentages of vaxxed vx unvaxxed in ICUs but also out of how many people and explain that is not the same thing to have 50% out of a pool of 4.95M vaxxed people and the other 50% to be out of a pool of 50k unvaxxed (real approximated stats from Ireland). Then, we can hopefully see people realizing how devastating it is for the healthcare system even a very small population of unvaxxed people."
3010,None of the vaccinators shown on the programme aspirated.
3011,"A reminder that singapore was one of the most mandated, masked and poked places at the start."
3012,"What is the point of boosters if you do not change the vaccines. The vaccines create spike protein from the original strain. We are in a Delta variant (highly mutated variant) pandemic. Boosters just increase anti-bodies for the original spike protein but anti-bodies wane, so we will need to keep giving boosters. We need to start modifying the vaccines to target the current variant.."
3013,DW: We would like to share how other countries...<br>Americans in the comment section: Nooooo...we are supposed to say how other countries need to run themselves yeeeehaaaawwww!!!!!
3014,"Solución inteligente.. Si alguien no quiere vacunarse y se contagia, debe pagar por su tratamiento.  Es lógico que prime lo colectivo sobre lo individual."
3015,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6uT8Q6QA3o&amp;t=9m30s"">9:30</a> - Ask Derrick:<br>For which groups are healthcare authorities recommending a third dose, and why?"
3016,"OK.<br>So if you&#39;re overweight, and have a heart attack, pay your own hospital bills..<br>If you&#39;re driving drunk, and have an accident, pay your own hospital bills..<br>If you have a dangerous hobby, and end up in trouble, pay your own hospital bills..<br>So if you play too much video games and collapse of exhaustion, pay your own hospital bills.<br>If you swim in rough seas, and need to be saved, pay your own hospital bills.<br>If you cycle in traffic and get hit by a car, pay your own hospital bills.<br>If you overdose on opiods, pay your own hospital bills.<br><br>Dangerous slippery slope there."
3017,"Following this logic, shouldn&#39;t obese people also pay more for their treatment, since overeating and bad lifestyle is also a choice with negative consequences, just like not getting vaccinated?"
3018,So then maybe the fully vaccinated that are also taking up beds should pay their own too!?
3019,A vaccine dose saves a life for U$ 100 max. A ventilator costs thousands of dollars.
3020,Aren&#39;t hospitals supposed to be for sick people? It&#39;s not reserved for well patients that are vaccinated
3021,Thanks for the coverage. Hope you can visit your family soon Ben. 🇦🇺
3022,"And Universal care, another right going through the window.<br><br>On top of that, if you are young COVID will not make you sick so how much incentive this punitive rules will have?"
3023,"I think in the UK we should give the life saving treatment, as we don&#39;t know the value of the person/life you save. They the unvaccinated should be discharged to continue their treatment at their cost in private care. You pay for your principles after initial life saving and free up the NHS for the vaccinated."
3024,Might be a great idea in getting those unvaccinated vaccinated.
3025,And how would they treat Covid? Any treatment is forbidden.
3026,"If they allow this, can we do the same with obese people who don&#39;t diet? After all, heart disease is the #1 killer even during this pandemic."
3027,"In regards to the topic title, it is quite hard to get a full understanding on the rationale and suitability of this policy at surface value. In addition, it is insinuating that the unvaccinated will incur heavy healthcare costs when in reality, there will still be substantial healthcare subsidies afforded to them, making the end cost more of a pinch/inconvenience rather than a debilitating financial penalty, with additional safety nets for those in the lower income brackets. While I understand that this is merely a short segment and not meant to be an in-depth commentary on the policy, it would have been more informative to briefly highlight several background information for those interested/concerned on this policy to read up on so as to gain a better prospective and understanding of Singapore&#39;s healthcare systems and the policy&#39;s implication/intention.<br><br>For those interested, do search on Singapore&#39;s healthcare system, subsidies and CPF Medi-save; especially it contributions, interest and government top-ups."
3028,Seems very fair to me.
3029,You can&#39;t have freedom without responsibility
3030,How come Africa w 1.2B people and 0%-14% &quot;fully vaccinated&quot; rate is incurring little to no covid sickness or death?<br><br>Anybody? lol
3031,"When can we do this for obese people and people that have STDs??? Obese people are by far a huge strain on the medical system from diabetes, to cancer, to heart and kidney problems etc etc etc."
3032,"Hmmmm I am conflicted, unvaccinated people are dumb, yes, but there is a lot of dumb things that public healthcare covers. Smoking,  drinking, doing silly stunts on your bike, antivaxxers getting things like whooping cough. Im not familiar with the Singapore system though so maybe just talking from my local perspective"
3033,.....90% of Singaporean vaccinated and the needs to get that number higher to reduce the load on hospitalizations seem like being between a hard place and a rock....good luck.
3034,Unvaccinated people should pay 20% of the hospital bill in Germany. Singapore is going the right way.
3035,"I like it more than vaccine mandates. Your body, your choice, your bill."
3036,So do the vaccinated have to pay aswell?
3037,That&#39;s fine.<br>Let the unvaccinated pay for their own Covid treatment...<br>But if people want a cheap repurposed off label treatment...<br>THAT should also be permitted.
3038,be good to hear independent expert speak
3039,Not just life but also money.. The wording in your introduction is revealing
3040,Money talks.This system will be world wide for the survival of public funded health systems.Years to go yet.
3041,"As always, we&#39;d love to include your questions in our upcoming shows! What would you like to know about the coronavirus pandemic? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23askderrick"">#askDerrick</a>"
3042,"I&#39;m from the USA. I&#39;ve always thought of going to Australia at some point in my life. Think it&#39;s a very interesting country. I&#39;m totally stunned at how this countries offices have treated there people! I feel for the people of Australia. I will never step foot in that country and I&#39;m sure others have the same feeling I&#39;m sure. &quot;The cost of freedom may be high, but never so costly as the lost of FREEDOM!&quot; Ronald Reagan"
3043,The unethical and dictatorial government in Australia is astonishing. I just can’t believe how far people have let their government go.
3044,This is insane how do you people let the govt overreact and overreach this badly
3045,Australia reminds me why I&#39;m grateful to be an American
3046,"I’m so grateful for living in the US state i live in. It’s normal, everyday life here (no masks or anything) and we’re only 50% vaccinated. Hospitals are running fine too, despite the fact that lots of people here are old, obese, and have other health issues that would make them more susceptible to being hospitalized by covid. We kept our freedom."
3047,It was once my dream to live in Australia…… I’ve now woken up
3048,You will forever be known as &quot;The tyranny down under&quot; after this.
3049,Gratings from Sweden where word lockdown don&#39;t exist even at the peak of pandemic ! So proud of my Sweden that they take democracy very seriously!
3050,It’s just the very beginning - what Australia has seen is nothing for what’s ahead
3051,"Australia isn’t only NSW and Victoria. Yes, they have opened their borders, but states like Western Australia haven’t. Poor management, both from the state and federally , means citizens are still stuck outside of the state with no concrete date on when they will be able to return to their homes. The whole of Australia is not open."
3052,"Australia&#39;s Federal governments astounding incompetence meant they didn&#39;t order early vaccines. The uptake &amp; management has been left to the states. That&#39;s why state leaders, both sides of politics, are getting pushback &amp; protests."
3053,"I live in Texas and my cousin moved to Australia back in 2014. he was always telling me how much better it is than America. How the government takes care of everything and all you have to worry about is not getting sunburned on the beach that day. But I always cherished The United States and the freedoms that we have compared to other countries. We may not be perfect, but at least we have The Bill of Rights."
3054,"From March 2020 to the early months of  2021 the UK only had a few  months of freedom during summer.<br>Even then , we were placed on a traffic light system where some parts of the UK had to remain in lockdown even Christmas was going to be cancelled..however they let us have Christmas day itself.<br>That&#39;s probably why So many in the UK will never accept another lockdown..<br>Thousands of us still work from home and many have lost their livelihoods, Jobs and homes and still fear the outside world..<br>Sometimes we think what was world War ll , for? <br>Those soldiers faced the war head on knowing that many shan&#39;t be returning .<br>However a virus? Caused governments to reak fear and havoc into our souls as we became inhibited and scared to venture into society..<br>This virus has treated us like a war..<br>So shouldn&#39;t we treat it as such also , <br>I&#39;d rather fight and  face death and  than sit around waiting for it..I can understand the overwhelming of hospitals ..<br>And money wasted couldve been used training more and more assistant nurses And newby Doctors to the fore..<br>Signing them up for a war..<br>Everyday people to help take the burden away from the professionals ..learn to assist regardless of not having the degrees and certifiable credentials..<br>It is what it is..<br>And it&#39;s not going away until the highly populated countries are minimised by it ...it&#39;s obvious! So we&#39;ve got this for years to come ..even other pandemics will slip in somewhere along the line..<br>I just feel our fight is only just beginning..<br>Vaccines And lockdowns can assist..<br>But it&#39;s only placing a pause on the inevitable..Variants are getting more aggressive and they&#39;re playing with us..<br>We however are causing the virus to be here longer than it needs to be."
3055,"She didn&#39;t mention Perth WA, nine deaths in two years, and we were open and operating as normal, the state made 5.7 Billion dollars in surplus budget, our government closed the borders to the cities that had covid, she did mention the wage subsidies to business and workers, she didn&#39;t mention that WA and QLD mining paid for it?"
3056,"It&#39;s not going back to normal for a long long time. Every time restrictions are loosened, there will be a spike and people will become afraid to go to restaurants etc again. So everybody has to live with either restrictions or a weak economy for the forseeable future. I think people will gradually tire of the restrictions, so the political pressure will gradually move towards lifting them, but that will mean more virus which will drag on economies for a long time."
3057,The reason for the lockdowns was the Federal Government only putting our bets on three vaccines when most developed nations placed their bets on six. This was also rather convenient as Federal MP&#39;s bought shares in AstraZeneca.
3058,People in Melbourne undoubtedly have suffered some of the harshest restrictions but Australia as a whole has done fine during covid.
3059,I visited Australia I loved it I left my heart ❤️ in Australia. People are beautiful! The country is beautiful.
3060,Waves of infections .. lol I got relatives all over the world all over Australia and not one person knows anybody who has got covid .. that one bar owner don&#39;t speak for every bar in Melbourne
3061,"Despite common cynicism of my country, the US, by other western nations, in the end I’ve always felt a natural kinship with the western world, particularly the English speaking western world. At a time I felt Australia was arguably the most similar country to the US on the planet (tied with perhaps Canada). They have a naturally rebellious attitude, certainly against the Brits, and one would think a quite libertarian mindset given the wide open rural landscape, bustling capitalist economy, and individualist-style attitude. A natural brother to the US… But feeling of kinship is gone. I cannot believe that a country so culturally similar to mine could react so brutally and so differently to this issue to the point where I don’t even recognize what I thought I knew before. What’s even more frightening are that many citizens seem to be OK with it, even encouraging it and seeing it as a good. What happened to Australia? When did they lose their way? How did it come to this? This isn’t the Australia I thought I knew…"
3062,And now its pretty much the complete opposite. Cases going at 150k a day which in a country with 25m people is a lot. The difference between now and August &#39;21 was hardly anyone was vaccinated.
3063,This is almost the same as what&#39;s happening in Malaysia... when my country has entered the 3rd lockdown since June.. but now they eased their restrictions although the cases are still stuck in between 5K &amp; 6K....
3064,"&quot;It&#39;s pretty much like an open air prison here.&quot; You do know, Australia used to be an open air prison?"
3065,"The situation in the two greatest countries in the world, Australia and New Zealand, has been greatly misrepresented by people who wish they were us. What people outside Australia and New Zealand didn&#39;t understand is that the majority supported the lockdown and vaccination measures, so in effect the governments were doing what the people wanted. That is actually how democratically elected governments are supposed to work.<br><br>People were not &quot;oppressed,&quot; they supported the measures.<br><br>People in the US think this is tyranny because they no longer understand what it means to support the government because they have lost their faith in institutions. The Europeans did what we did, but they were months and months too slow, because they are European."
3066,"It&#39;s been months since we in South Australia have had a single case and yet we still have to wear masks and check in everywhere and I was told now my mask exemption (I&#39;m fully vaccinated) didn&#39;t count anymore at our doctors clinic. We are seriously over it, when is it going to be over!"
3067,"Eliminating the virus seem to require eliminating certain freedoms. It is completely valid to choose liberty over safety in this case, sometimes security can come at too high a cost."
3068,"Sounds like Australia needs to replace the government . But the same can be said about America&#39;s government, I know easier said than done  😷"
3069,"Open to Europeans? LoL, good luck Australia."
3070,"It is a shame what is happening in Australia, life without freedom is not worth living."
3071,This is very biased reporting. Most of Australia has had very few lockdowns and we’re living mostly normal lives. Melbourne and Sydney have been hardest hit but they are not all of Australia. And the convict reference is ridiculous and obviously playing to prejudices and lack of knowledge of the international audience. Shame on you DW.
3072,I wouldn&#39;t want to visit this tyranny of a state. God forbid you go on vaca and boom lock down.
3073,"If the world and especially my country had done this 18 months ago, we could be back to business as usual right now. My favorite restaurants wouldn&#39;t be closed. Now it&#39;s far too late, the &quot;back to normal&quot; option is not on the table anymore."
3074,As a non Australian I can only see this without going there.
3075,Who would like to go to Australia right now as tourist? Almost nobody.
3076,If I was Australian I would be livid at the Covid hysteria and the &#39;restrictions&#39; that have been enforced.
3077,The US CDC director just said (yesterday) that over 75% of covid deaths were in people with at least four comorbidities with average age at TOD of 72 years old.
3078,"Meanwhile in Cape Town we living our normal lives, i have omnicron right now and it&#39;s weak AF. Just end all lockdowns and get back to normal life"
3079,My request to open all international borders so that people meet their loved one.. If vaccine corona continued people will hopelessly be died in orher countries...
3080,&quot;It is a small rootless international clique that is turning people against each other and preventing them from having peace.&quot;
3081,I am scared as an international student who wants to come in Australia for higher education because govt is all over the place they might go with lockdown any day….
3082,"Is everyone in Melbourne Greek? I knew there is a big Greek minority there, but I was surprised to see so many Greek surnames."
3083,Can someone please answer my question? Is it lockdown now at Australia??? My friend told me it&#39;s still lockdown and will open at December 20. Is this true??
3084,Stand up for your freedom and basic human rights Australia
3085,"I normally like DW b/c it&#39;s so balanced but this journalist was a bit extreme to call Australia  a land of petty criminals .. we&#39;ve kind of moved on since then.  Australia could easily level certain criticisms out of Germany&#39;s history, too - but what would be the point in that given that people have moved on ..  Also, as others have pointed out - restrictive lockdown really only happened in Victoria.  Most of the country was pretty relaxed.  Until recently, the ACT was pretty much living as normal until the short 2021 lockdown which has now been lifted"
3086,Catherine you were really good 👍 thankfully it’s Australian summer now 🥳
3087,"J Bhattacharya, is the Head of Medicine at Stanford University California (and also an expert in infectious diseases) and recently said “the lockdowns were the biggest public health mistake, of all time.”"
3088,"&#39;Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety&#39;<br>-Benjamin Franklin"
3089,I&#39;m an international airline pilot and have had layovers in Australia and China in the last two years.  Australia is actually much worse than Communist China.  It is astonishing to see in person how the Left has ruined the Aussie psyche in so short a time.  One day I pray they pay back these monsters in full.
3090,"The Australian &quot;Prime&quot; Minister called for &quot;calm&quot; over Omigodcron. I was already calm, mate."
3091,"Scary that we are teaching a younger generation that we are scared adults, and being scared and making emotional decisions overrules logic."
3092,"The worst is over for now, but as we can see with Europe, it can come back next winter.  We may be better placed with the high vaccination rate due to long lockdowns."
3093,ask if this would have happened to an armed population ?
3094,People at some point will snap. But with no weapons they will be at mercy of those that do.
3095,"Imagine if governments took this stance and this effort against smoking. That kills a lot of people each year… governments seem to be ok with “my body, my choice” on this subject."
3096,"Do the best to protect your sick and elderly, if they so choose, and get on with it.  COVID doesn&#39;t kill young and healthy people.  This is hysteria is nuts."
3097,"I’m from WA , I am sick of the boarders being shut, open then already . I used to like mark mcgowan  out Leader but not anymore . Just open the boarders already so we can live as normal as we can ."
3098,"How did New Zealand do it though, were they also draconian in their approach?"
3099,"Try living in my country, we&#39;ve been oppressed for years."
3100,"Uh… yeah sure right , there’s no way I would every take a trip there.  <br>You might get stuck in a Tyranny lockdown."
3101,The whole Asia / Pacific / Oceania region has been a disaster for airlines. <br>Best not to choose an airline career!
3102,New strain has certainly thrown a spanner in the works.😔
3103,"There seems to be a strange notion in Australia and various CEO&#39;s, particularity Qantas CEO Alan Joyce, that the the vaccine is magic!<br>Trouble is, the situation is Singapore and Europe suggests it&#39;s just delaying the time of reckoning."
3104,They need to overthrow their government. They cannot let them get away with this. Australia has gone insane.
3105,serves them right for giving up their guns<br>I hope they lock them all up.
3106,"I saw this coming in &#39;96 and &#39;02 when Aussies neutered their own right to self-defense. If y&#39;all as a people ever get the chance to own firearms again, remember this lesson..."
3107,I raise my glass in a toast to the good times that will be had when the control freaks are put to bed.
3108,It’s funny how the presenter skimmed over the part where citizens weren’t allowed to leave their own country. If some Asian nation had done so it would have made headlines. The bit about the Australian Government not allowing Aussies to leave has now gotten a lot of Aussies and the entire world wondering whether Australians are still living with a prison mentality.
3109,THE ONLY PANDEMIC IS A PANDEMIC OF FEAR.
3110,They have been on lockdown for awhile. One would think covid would be gone🙄
3111,There is a price for everything in life.
3112,AMERICA STAND UP BEFORE THIS REACHES OUR SHORES!!
3113,Its easy to fool people from a distance. My mom was scared I would be shot while out hunting. On the private land I went. There was actually little danger of that
3114,"20000 nurses have cancelled their registration. Cases are on the rise as we head into the Christmas period. <br><br>I put my money on a health system overload by January after the virus has spread all over the country during Christmas.<br><br>We have been here many times before, we open up and show the world how lucky we are only to lockdown a few months later. This is far from over"
3115,I think that there is something secret reason. <br>Pendemic and vaccine mandate is just blowing smoke.<br>Be patient! <br>Let&#39;s enjoy the daily life.
3116,Western Australia had a short lockdown when COVID was first discovered and another scare with a 2 week lockdown. <br>We live a 2019 like life.
3117,ITS<br>FAR<br>FROM<br>OVER
3118,Austria fast coming up from behind !😉
3119,"when I see young people in the thumbnail with double masks and plastic screens on their head I would say no, the worst of this pandemic is not over <br>🐑"
3120,Hopefully I can finally visit Deutschland<br>The Fatherland
3121,"Its not as bad as it sounds for me at least, and i live in Victoria"
3122,Wow... this makes Australia look like such a joke.
3123,I don&#39;t recognise my former country anymore. Just thankful I got out of there before Covid came and the government turn communist. Never going back.
3124,Wow ! What happened to this place ?   Looks like it turned into a giant prison camp. I was just listening to Elton John live in Australia. Looks like that kind of freedom will never happen there again. Too bad. Australia was on my bucket list. BTW Israel has the highest vaccination rates but has the highest cases of covid.
3125,"Seems draconian, so sad to see their freedom die like that.    WALK OFF YOUR LINES! HELP YOURSELVES"
3126,"If you don&#39;t stand for something, you&#39;ll fall for everything/anything. You people are so gullible!"
3127,Remember to keep comments respectful and follow “our” community guidelines 😂 <br><br>What a trampling in free speech “our”
3128,"600 days for only 25 million people, that&#39;s just government incompetence."
3129,Imean i sont agree with them either. But there is no need to lie. Its not the whole country. My state had slme of tge lowest covod numbers in the world. And we have barely been in lockdown after the initial long one.<br><br>Havent been locked down bassically all year.
3130,I beg to disagree. Philippines has the harshest lockdown. You can get killed by breaking it.
3131,Hardest lock downs in the world. Whats happening? I hope someone studies the total after effects of the lock downs.
3132,Canada has same policy and Canadians can no longer travel within the country or fly out of the country without the medicine pass.
3133,"It will be very interesting what happens in the next southern hemisphere winter. The delta wave reached Australia quite late, and we know that Covid spreads fastest during winter in temperature countries due to people heading indoors. A harsh lockdown is only as meaningful as people are willing to follow the rules. There is no question it works in East and Southeast Asian countries where the vast majority follow the rules, and anti-mask protests and anti-vaxx movements are unknown. The scenes played out in Melbourne and Sydney would NEVER happen in Beijing, Tokyo, Seoul or Ho Chi Minh City. It should be apparent by now that social solidarity and the sense of social responsibility is much stronger in Asia than in the West."
3134,"Opening ,the lines of airways ,would be ,very , very, dangerous ,for the lives of peoples.This is another great mistake!"
3135,Lets hope there are Nuremburg type trials for the coppers &quot;just following orders&quot;
3136,I wonder how many have gone completely insane or have committed suicide over these extreme lockdowns? ADD those deaths to the total for Australia 😥
3137,LET THE PEOPLE BE FREE!!
3138,It&#39;s a good thing that the coffee guy is protecting his beard.
3139,NO MORE LOCKDOWNS!!
3140,They were just trying to keep out all of the people from the surrounding countries.
3141,Thank you DW for such amazing content.
3142,Thank you DW for another great report on the enviroment. &quot;Carbon-dioxide emissions are expected to return to pre-pandemic highs this year.&quot; That&#39;s sad to hear...
3143,I just went ahead and liked the video before watching cuz I know it&#39;s gonna be great as they are always. Thanks DW 😁
3144,"It&#39;s funny, because on your channel and others when the first big Covid shutdown in China occurred, you showed images of Beijing and other cities with clear skies and visibility. That seems like a side-benefit that heretofore had not been present. AS the cities opened back up there was a reduction in air quality, but there was also a slight improvement still to be seen. How it will be with coal-fired plants reopening for the winter, I&#39;m sure will show a reduction."
3145,"As always, we&#39;d love to include your questions in our upcoming shows! What would you like to know about the coronavirus pandemic? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23askderrick"">#askDerrick</a>"
3146,"As usual, the public doesn&#39;t give a damn."
3147,I’ve managed this entire pandemic with 5 or so cloth masks.
3148,"Some rough calculations I did; Assuming everyone from 9 January 2020 to today (18 November 2021) used a disposable surgical mask once every 24h and got rid of it once it was used, that would mean that so far the amount of masks used would be  5272.8 Billion. Of course the real number of masks used is much smaller, but it would still be an astounding amount. Quite hard to make a better estimate since people would be mostly staying inside / some use their masks more than once, among other factors."
3149,SADLY IT HAS NEVER BEEN PLASTIC&#39;S PROBLEM FOR MILLIONS OF TONS ENDING UP IN OUR RIVERS AND OCEANS BUT IGNORANT CITIZENS WHO GLADLY PUT IT THERE!!
3150,"Anti- maskers will love this video. To put this into perspective I&#39;m sure plastic bags are still causing much more environmental destruction than masks. I&#39;m pretty sure there are at least a hundred other things that are causing more harm to the environment than masks. But hey, you can make a video about any product&#39;s environmental impact."
3151,The only thing that matters is our behavior.
3152,"Why haven&#39;t there been regulatory specifics and standards for the protective devices  we put in our faces? I don&#39;t trust China to make my face filters unregulated.  Or even regulated, for that matter."
3153,IF ONLY GOVERNMENTS HAD SPECIAL BINS URGING CITIZENS TO DISPOSE OF THEM IN THESE???!!!
3154,The media today:  take all known heavily covered news topics and somehow make them interconnected with COVID 19
3155,why are you focusing on some end of the pipe line problem what should masks be made of who&#39;s making them who&#39;s handling the garbage who&#39;s mandating masks be worn??Maybe talk to those people.
3156,"true story: I am using my 10th mask since the start of the pandemic :) After I have seen this, I plan to keep using it for a few more months."
3157,Who didn’t see this coming?
3158,Yeah the benifits are only monitory and only for the few
3159,Oop. I throw my mask into my laundry. XD
3160,Is mask not degraable 🤔
3161,cloth masks. good grief.
3162,where is the money going when you pay for your emmision.
3163,lets throw some face masks to the ocean
3164,"jokes on you, i wear the same mask for weeks hahahahahhaha"
3165,You think after centuries of abusing the world year will make any difference? Ok if you don’t under msg and this go eat cakes and fast food fro the next 10 years and then go work out in the gym one day And let us know how well you do
3166,except  its not china that brought us to this level its europe and then the USA
3167,Hmmm cus airplanes are still flying with empty seats

3188,"I am very happy to be in Kenya. Our children wear masks, my son started wearing mask when he started school at 4years old. Now, he cannot leave without it. Children learn and pick up habits very fast and stick to it. I find it political or awkward to see children having an opinion on this, yet they went to school with masks at one time. Further, children should not be getting sick and it is very irresponsible for adults to let them get exposure or start fighting considerably well tested and proven methods just because they have political opinions. What happpened to the greater good? It is clear in countries with older populations that yes, coronavirus is a problem for the older unvaxed. However, children have the same outcomes world over except in places where the adults decide to play politics and Russian roulette with their care. Sad."

It doesn’t take much effort to put it on to help prevent virus infection. This is the health practice for themselves and the general public.

3218,Cloth masks have been shown to be ineffective.  Does the scientist have any explanation why new infections are soaring in Germany?  Perhaps the settings in which people are expected to wear masks is not where the majority of infections ever occurred.

3262,Worst thing you can do during cold and flu season is hands to the face. Germs and bacteria collect on the fingers and spread with touching of the mouth nasal passages and eyes. What do we have people doing all day now? Hands to the face constantly to reajust and take off masks to speak eat hanging them on rearview mirrors digging them out of purses and pockets. This is the absolute worse thing you can do.

3279,"I was just in Germany a couple months ago. Did you know that you are not even allowed to wear a cloth mask there? NOPE, when I was getting off the plane in Frankfurt from the US, there was a smiling German standing at the terminal door handing out medical grade masks and making us use those instead. So right now in Germany, medical masks, N-95 or KN-95 are all you are allowed to wear. So if Germany is almost 70% vaccinated and has the strictest masking laws in the world, why are their cases and deaths through the roof right now?

3288,I&#39;m an Australian.  I don&#39;t see how you can blame Germany for not being allowed into Australia.  Australia took the disgraceful decision to not allow it&#39;s own citizens back to their place of birth. Australia had a good run with CovID at the expense of dis-owning it&#39;s own citizens and expecting foreign health services to look after them while stranded overseas. This could have been easily avoided by putting some tents up in a remote location and setting up a dedicated quarantine system.
3289,Thanks for this informative video: It’s deeply true and uplifting that you forecast the concept that we need to change our paradigm: together and with solidarity to manage the pandemic challenge.
3290,"I can empathize as an immigrant living in a big German city we got really stuck in our apartments without access to family (overseas) or many positive options for health and wellbeing. I felt threatened and intimidated by the state and authorities. I am a working person who tries to follow the rules, went in quarantine, took precautions, and got my vaccinations. <br>Case in point the Police confronted me walking my dog outside alone and gave a 50 EUR mask ticket (despite no signs about maskenpflicht). Said I need to &quot;self inform&quot; and totally harsh and cold. Now I see more Police than ever in my city. Marching around in little squadrons, driving vans down the park paths, shining very bright lights on people, and I guess playing hide &amp; seek with local youth.<br>Focus is on all the case #&#39;s, deaths, threats, and restrictions. Germany was very quick and happy to march out that catalog of fines... all the things you CAN&#39;T do!<br><br>Would be nice to think about a positive approach: What are the safe and healthy options? How can you encourage and reward &quot;good&quot; behavior? How can you better inform the public about positive choices and complicated rule changes? What can the state and cities do for youth and all citizens to promote good health and sense of community in these times? What mechanisms can the state imagine to partner with German companies &amp; innovate such that businesses can re-open?"
3291,I feel sorry for the restaurant owners and others.Imagine they had to close down for such a long time last year and now they can only take vaccinated people in.
3292,The German concept of &quot;Erpressung&quot; means coercion as well as blackmail.

3295,"I took a vax with the impression that it was supposed to give me immunity.  Bit by bit, they lowered that to &#39;enhanced immune reaction&#39; and probably taking boosters for the rest of my life.  I don&#39;t like the anti-vaxxers, but most of the unvaccinated that I&#39;ve met aren&#39;t anti-vaxxers - they just don&#39;t like the idea of being forced to take a shot of something that has been so rushed."

3298,Therapeutics are said to be almost ready to be available. Hope this crazy saga around vaccination will be behind us soon!
3299,"There&#39;s one thing I fail to understand: Nov 2020, our infection rate in Europe (at least in Belgium, Netherlands and Germany) are lower of today, Nov 2022. (Just mentioning 8 Nov 2021, Belgium has a single day infection rate of 15822 people from a population of just 11 million. That&#39;s mind bugling)<br>Yet we had no vaccination back then. How come??<br>We acknowledge that vaccine does help preventing infected from dying, that&#39;s why we see the death toll is much lower than last year (by far).<br>Now if we acknowledge that we aren&#39;t capable of preventing people from getting infected (variants, etc), but we can help preventing ICU cases and death toll. Then why we cannot come up with meds, food supplement or even health guide??<br>If the goal is only to prevent ICU cases and death toll, then why not guide population to better health conditions?? If you tune your health level to highest, you are very unlikely to die from any infection. <br>That should be a good way to guide or even force population to tune their health level to max to prevent death. Bad consumption behaviour and bad life style will be punished and banned (such as bad food, late night party, indulgence, excessive drinking, etc).<br>I don&#39;t think we can go to any lockdowns any longer since we aren&#39;t able to print free money to people and dilute into expected strongly growing economy next year. We see this from last year, all ECB printouts went to inflation, same story in US. We cannot dilute over printed currency into further suffocating economy. We need durable system (strict rules, but let business open, maybe no large gathering) to keep economy survive. <br>Believe me, no matter the situation of COVID in 2022, the biggest challenge we are facing will be ECONOMY! Inflation will not stop, please understand that. By then no one will be talking about climate, pandemic, They will be talking about economical surviving!"

3337,"why are you blaming the unvaccinated people of the surge? blame the origin of the virus and the big pharma.<br><br>c19 is airborne. testing, treatment, isolate, contact tracing.<br><br>why did you let the vaccinated leave untested where vaccine is not an assurance of not catching the virus?<br><br>face mask. social distancing, and personal hygine are very essential."
3338,The biggest mistake European governments made is not to emphasise to the vaccinated that they still can be (re) infected and subsequently spread it to both the vaccinated and not vaccinated. Safe distancing measures and mask mandates should have been continued even for the vaccinated.
3339,God Bless and stay safe
3340,"Vaccination reduces the chance of severe illness. It , and I repeat, does not eliminate it.  <br><br>Also vaccine sceptics did not take the vaccine in the first place. So there&#39;s that."
3341,"what went wrong? lifting all restriction on vaccinated peoples, without telling peoples of the risk of spreadin the virus."
3342,Here in the uk we e started looking at number of cases in hospital and deaths not the number of cases
3343,"&quot;Society says your opinion doesn&#39;t matter&quot;, &quot;We need solidarity&quot; oh humans."
3344,Vaccine hesitancy comes from wanting long term safety data......thalidomide still reverberates 60yrs later......
3345,"First a quality dialogue has to begin with the anti-vaccine community and the biology of mRNA vaccines. The most important statistics like % sickness among unvaccinated and vaccinated people. however i do agree that these vaccines have been manufactured with secret patents in private labs deeply disturbing.<br><br>But this can have an effect only if the state shows they are doing their part, which is to increase the standard for health, hire more people, decrease hours with equal pay. And we are seeing a pandemic for the vaccinated as well."
3346,Derrick Williams needs his own show
3347,"blackmail does not have anything to do with how safe the blackmail/vaccination is. 🤣🙈.<br><br>If you believe that, you don&#39;t understand what blackmail is. <br><br>Actually this reflects the common problem. Politics and Media hear, but don&#39;t listen - or understand."
3348,"The final section, answering the question about side effects down the line, is very much directed at people that are already scientifically driven/curious/savvy... It is not direct enough for people that actually think there might be side effects down the line."
3349,"Meanwhile the UK (especially England…). Listening to DW makes me feel like I live in alternate universe in England, where apparently is doing “as planned” 🤦🏻‍♀️"
3350,"Can someone explain me 5 medical staff by 1 Covid patient footages. No medicine to help, no drips to help, no surgeries can help, why there are always 5+ medical personal caring for 1 Covid patient?"
3351,Germany is doing just fine
3352,"I went to get some take out Chinese food the other day, holy cow it was $40 for two people.  And all the tables were empty, almost no employees, no customers, high prices, they are in dire straights..."
3353,Asian countries vaccination rate is over 80% despite getting the vaccines much later.
3354,"wow, I didn&#39;t realize that Germany still hasn&#39;t achieved full social integration with the old East German parts."
3355,The interviewer talks about patients. The professor speaks about vacines
3356,"Save the medical staff!  Implement triage using an established system like APACHEll, scores over 17?  have poor outcomes even when given intensive treatment.  Give them compassionate comfort care only."
3357,"You clearly have not, or will not report on , the Harvard based study recently published in The European journal of Epidemiology, which shows statisically that Covid is spreading among the vaccinated. Do your job as the 4th estate  and report on all of the scientific data."
3358,Please look after yourselves x
3359,People actively fighting free medical cafe.amazing.
3360,Why did the pharmaceutical companies sign a waver of immunity for any liabilities??
3361,It would be good to know what percentage of those  hospitalized are unvaccinated: all I&#39;m hearing is mainly unvaccinated  are hospitalized
3362,"Never lift mask mandatory until all countries zero case for few months. I can understand they let full capacity of stadium, restaurant and other public facilities but must wear mask and vaccinated if you anti vaccine at least wear mask"
3363,I am glad that I am living in Japan.
3364,"What went wrong?????these kinds of questions are really pissing me off<br>&quot;SUMMER&quot; is what happened.....people were all over each other without masks in the clubs in restaurants.........people just dont care,this was expected after how we behaved ....why are people shocked?"
3365,"Why did they allow huge soccer matches, tourism and carneval events ?"
3366,Those who haven&#39;t vaccinated should also avoid  other vaccinations .

Within the EU it doesn&#39;t matter how many cases who has, if you&#39;re vaxxed or can show a negative covid test you can travel anywhere you want..."
3369,"This virus will go through everyone in world, no other option, study the history of virus country wise,"
3370,If they don&#39;t want to get vaccinated they should at least wear masks and follow some health protocols for their protection
3371,"DW is financed via funding from the state, i.e. from tax revenue. Confirmation bias is looking for what one already believes is right. How does that apply here?"
3372,"we really have a problem now... somehow everyone around you is getting sick....... :( my best friend is now also sick and double vaccinated. this is all getting out of hand.<br><br>i think next week everything is closed :(("
3373,The real question should be...what went right?
3374,This is the one only product from its staying from long time that&#39;s sad
3375,"👍👌🇨🇦❤, come to Canada and see the mess we are in, many due to poor political leadership or lack of,"
3376,The uk have had high case rates which put twenty percent of the population have the virus and this immunity is not waning science has found. It had high cases in spring summer this year all of which ups our overall immunity levels before winter came.  Germany had low levels at the same time so low natural immunity before winter.
3377,"Hands up if you miss your parents, since you haven&#39;t seen them for two years."
3378,"I love how the scientists tell us that the vaccine is 💯 %safe and that all the tests were done. Ok then, show me the longterm test results. I will be happy with 10 years out"
3379,I am not criticizing any leader and any country but it the very beginning there was a lot of scaremongering going around from leaders of many countries and I reckon now this come to the consequences that should have been more positive but at the Beginning it was political so you have this problem now and I blame the leaders of many countries I&#39;m not naming any Pacific countries
3380,just an amazing business.
3381,"The Lost Man Parable<br><br>A man having lost his way while returning home found himself in a dangerous situation where the surrounding were full of wild ferocious beast and poisonous snakes . By chance he met a Wise man who knows how to deal with these dangerous animals,<br><br>The wise man asked &quot;Poor fellow, do you know you are in the midst of ferocious beast and poisonous snakes ? Why do you come this way? Do you have any means to deal with this ferocious beast ?&quot;<br><br>Upon hearing this, the man realized his danger and asked for help. The Wise man than caught hold of his hand and guide him out of this dangerous situation to safety. The Wise man then said &quot;Be wise now and do not tread this Path again. As once you get into this Path, it is very difficult to get out and you may perish on this Path.&quot;<br><br>The erring man was very grateful and rejoiced at being let out of danger. Before they parted, the Wise Man once again reminded him, &quot;Whenever you met any of your friends and relatives, be they male or female, young or old, this Path is full of Danger. If they come to this Path by mistake, they might lost their Lives. Tell them not to be foolish and face Danger unnecessarily."
3382,Situation bad in several countries
3383,"During the last week reported, Germany averaged about 236,682 doses administered each day. At that rate, it will take a further 71 days to administer enough doses for another 10% of the population.. what went wrong?"
3384,The bottomline is the vaccination campaign was not compelling enough in the beginning ( due to several factors) and now it&#39;s too late.
3385,"In Germany we are going to have winter and our immune system is no more used to do its  work as usual. That is, whats happening."
3386,The economist&#39;s calculation is credible. Some cities in Russia were 9 times undervalued.
3387,"Surely the way to avoid the confusion is to monitor overall death rates.<br>If a Country experiences a 50,000 increase in deaths in 2021 (over the pre C19, 5 year average) this can be attributed to C19. <br>Whether it&#39;s direct, a co - morbidity factor or simply a delay in unrelated treatments caused by the pressure on resources is almost irrelevant to the C19 death toll."
3388,"Excellent reporting, excellent set of guests."
3389,TL;DR: We know the real number of COVID-19 deaths is in between the counted deaths and the excess deaths (in countries where accurate counts are kept of both). But we really have no idea where in the huge gap the true number lies. So we are left with an estimate that it is a large number of deaths and it could be much larger.
3390,"According to The Economist, outside of Europe and the Americas, few places even track excess deaths. <br><br>Staticians used to work with excess deaths say that India had as much as 2 million people dead by COVID in early May. <br><br>As for Latin America, except for Ecuador, all other South American countries have pretty correct COVID numbers when compared to Excess Deaths. <br><br>The same can&#39;t be said about Central America and Mexico"
3391,COVID could be considered a co- morbidly or catalyst as far as cause of death is concerned in many cases. Hence the blur in the death toll accounting.
3392,This is a question for people who have had covid and it implies to the 1st days of contracting the virus..Was it like the flu where you just start taking cold n flu medicines and if so did they help ??
3393,"At least three times and possibly over four times. Some countries do not bother to get it right as it went over counting or reporting them. It will be clear in some years, but nations are buckling under pressure of struggling thru, so priority is not to try to make count at the moment. Also, some countries are discouraging reporting as it reflects negativiy on their current auhtority prestige and they actually are preventing it happening. Many people aren&#39;t willing to notify the authority as they are concerned that their relatives being turned into ashes as mandates go. So, it is complicated from nation to ethnically regions that are traditionally opposed to."
3394,"In the Netherlands we have 2 figures: the statistics that never lie and the tests taken.<br>The statistical deaths are almost twice as high as the official death figure.<br>Most notable was that in 2020, most people died outside the hospital. Only a small portion reached ICU.<br>This has mostly to do with a very bad governmental management."
3395,Here in my country.. we have  500 under deaths every day... Our Daily Recoveries are around 2000 to 3000.
3396,"In my country México, the president and the authorities say &quot;Nothing happens&quot;, it is sad they have not turned to look elsewhere, the pandemic has not ended."
3397,At the least some groups are bold enough to reveal the truth . 👍<br>Good to know ...
3398,"In the UK GPs won&#39;t see patients, so we are stocking up on this crisis!"
3399,"I&#39;m in a country of 7k+ islands, with isolated communities. There&#39;s bound to be COVID cases that are unreported.<br><br>We already acknowledge that the true figure might be 2,3 or 4 times in actual."
3400,"If you are news, please don&#39;t put music on your video&#39;s. Be subjective, factual. I am watching the news, not Schindler&#39;s List. It&#39;s distracting, unnecessary and not worthy of DW."

3402,"I didn&#39;t know we learned that the loss of smell wasn&#39;t due to the olfactory neuron being infected. That&#39;s very reassuring to me, I previously thought the virus might enter the brain that way."
3403,Could it be 1/5? Medical knowledge is a guessing game. My mother died because they guessed wrong.
3404,Derrick Williams&#39; on-screen manner is refreshing.
3405,Why has all world wide funding for tuberculosis (which each year takes more lives of all ages than any other disease) been terminated?
3406,"The question of death with or by COVID is not that much of a logical boondoggle. We are told in other contexts that  very dangerous and expensive  operations like heart transplants are worthwhile, because life is the most precious gift,  and even a few months or years, perhaps with a much reduced  quality of life, offsets all negative aspects. So why the about turn with COVID? I say for the sake of intelligibility and logical consistency of medical practice and moral/ethical positions, dying with COVID is dying of COVID because sans COVID  the person would have lived longer, whether for a few weeks, months or years."
3407,"Loss of sense of smell can also be the sign of early stages of Parkinson&#39;s disease, as well as dementia. Take that symptom seriously, guys! Y&#39;all can start eating cardboard after loosing it. Life would be so dull."
3408,"Why don&#39;t you take, say, a five-year average of deaths from various diseases and then measure it against the reported deaths from all diseases during these pandemic years?"
3409,"As always, we&#39;d love to include your questions in our upcoming shows! What would you like to know about the coronavirus pandemic? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23askderrick"">#askDerrick</a>"

3424,I have trouble getting the medical treatment I need for chronic illness because the hospitals are full of unvaccinated COVID patients. Without frequent ongoing medical treatment I won&#39;t live that much longer.

3488,I feel sorry for the kids
3489,"As a former teacher, I&#39;d have to add that many teachers are terrified of going to work now because of this and I know of several people who ended up quitting teaching (mostly elementary) because the masks were no longer mandated and they felt unsafe to continue teaching. They were vaccinated, but vaccines are not perfect and some of these teachers were in the risk group. The few individuals that quit were some of the best elementary teachers I&#39;ve met in my career.<br>This by itself will cause a tremendous damage to the educational system long term and has already started affecting certain countries where masks are not mandated"
3490,"Yes, PLEASE stop scaring kids!<br>Healthy kids have the same risc to get seriously ill from covid as from influenca. The risc is VERY low."
3491,They should talk about the unusually large number of soccer players and athletes that are dropping from heart attacks lately.
3492,"Wow, an 8 years old who talks perfect German, here I&#39;m 18 years old who struggles. German education really outdid itself."
3493,This dr. Maske says that wearing a mask by a child is an injustice to them🙄<br>His job as a peadiatrician is to worry about the health and safety of the children.why is it not an injustice that thousands of children are vaccinateted needlessly?!!
3494,That was intensly well said 👏
3495,"At least 112 Virginia children were given wrong doses of COVID-19 vaccines after a local pharmacy tried to make up for not having the new shots for kids, according to local officials."
3496,One thing is for certain <br>The fear is well and truly entrenched in that generation now and for many many years to come
3497,Have kids told adults and other kids that the mass are affecting them in such a bad way? Where did the adults tell the kids that was the case and put it in their minds or maybe it&#39;s only in the minds of the adults? My point is kids are more resilient than adults sometimes
3498,Would you risk your own child? Only 1 case? What if that 1 case is your child?<br><br>Minimal risk is very different from NO risk from a mother&#39;s point of view.
3499,"why should kids need the prophylactic drug, for that matter those who have already had covid and had no problems, what about teachers - they can get the prophylactic drug if they are concerned.  The current average IFR% is 0.15%.  so those 0.15% should be given the drug and those that have other health issues should get it."
3500,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XOcU6dAiVs&amp;t=05m10s"">05:10</a> it is ridiculous to insist that children wear masks while adults can go to clubs and restaurants 👍"

3503,"very nice interview, we need to strike a balance"
3504,How HORRIBLY SAD to see the fear being sown in the youngest generation by ignorant parents. This is cruelty that needs to be stopped and punished. My 4 year old grandson who started Junior Kindergarten in September did not wear a mask as it was deemed voluntary in Kindergarten.  We have learned however that if he does not wear a mask in the classroom he is not allowed to play with the other children and must stay 6ft away from them at all times. So much for the  anti-bullying policy that schools claim to abide by. I am beyond disgusted with this horror show and YES I do wish harm on all those who have wittingly or unwittingly caused irreparable harm to others.  There is NO EXCUSE for being ignorant of the damage caused by this plandemic ...sadder still are the sheep who happily walk to slaughter.
3505,once again the children must suffer for the adults inability to take action and do what needs to be done. now they have to face more hardships growing up...hope their kids like the world burning/drowing with global warming.

3521,"I like the comparison of adults who want to not have their rights infringed upon through the wearing of facemasks while in public as to children aged 5 to 12 who are told they don&#39;t need to wear facemasks all the time while in school or outside playing with friends.  So here is the case of medical staff who are knowledgable in preventing viral particles from being inhaled with the use of N95 facemasks while working in the hospitals and clinics, yet, the general population doesn&#39;t want to wear a mask that will do the same thing in restaurants, bars, public spaces, and entertainment venues.  Is it an infringement of my rights as a human being from being infected by another person in a crowded space because the other person didn&#39;t want to wear their facemask?  Or is my rights revoked because I&#39;m not wearing my facemask; I am willing to take the risk of eventually being very sick and going onto a ventilator and dying."

3554,"I would agree to skip masks for kids if kids ( AND teachers) are tested every morning first thing.

The hospitals are filling up again, I have a relative in Colorado USA where they are going to crisis staffing (allowed to cut staffing on labor intensive coronavirus patients in half, relatives have to come in to help with hygiene).

3586,When was the last time in human history when you have to continuously take the same vax/drug to ensure the functionality of your immunity against a virus?!?!
3587,"They say &quot;vaining&quot; immunity, but are only measuring the antibody protein concentrate, or in fact the result on cells in a petri dish.<br>But the main and deep strenght in the immunity, depends on the ability in the t and b cells and the memorystructures and other proteins and structural functions on the different organs and structures that are attacked by the virus.<br>The antibody effect in the lymf and blood fluids that are &quot;measured&quot;, are, mainly the first front in attacking and fighting down the virus."
3588,"The amount of antibody is supposed to wane as time goes on and it&#39;s the memory T and B cells from the adaptive immune system that keep us safe. Why, then, are scientists still using the antibody level to determine whether or not we need a booster?"
3589,You need a booster to boost the booster to boost the booster...and so it goes on.
3590,4 in under 1 year! We did it team! If we really focus I think we can get 2 more next year!
3591,This is not actually testing for efficacy against covid. This is a test for your IQ and brain functionality. How many shots does it take for you to realize this aint right?
3592,"This vaccine reminds me of Sunscreen. Sunscreen only lasts MAX 2 hours and you have to reapply. However, you have to be sure to reapply before that 2 hours is up because a lapse in effect will result in skin cancer, etc. So, this vaccine only lasts for 4-6 months....but no one actually knows when their particular body begins to lapse in protection. So really, if you want to be safe, you need to take a booster every 3 months just to be sure you have applied &quot;protection&quot; recently enough to feel &quot;protected. Oh, but still, you can get &quot;mild cases of sunburn&quot; (COVID) and people are like &quot;This ish is great!&quot;"
3593,I bet Derek Williams had no idea about the amount of screen time he would have at this job
3594,Yes but how do we break the wave after that?!

3598,Why has all world wide funding for tuberculosis (which each year takes more lives of all ages than any other disease) been terminated?

3600,Got my booster 2 days ago and man it really made my whole body ache and have chills and no energy. If it saves my life or keeps me out of hospital a day or 2 of feeling poorly is well worth it! I&#39;m done now though. I will get no more shots.
3601,"The nurse at the beginning of this podcast did not ASPIRATE, drawback before injecting the vaccination content, this can cause THE VACCINE TO BE INJECTED INTO A VAIN which could cause issues that could be a contributor in people getting blood clots and/or contributing to other issues.

3606,"I would be happy to take the third dose, in exchange for not having to wear muzzles. But since muzzles are mandatory (however difficult and pointless their enforcement is), I wouldn&#39;t take it, because I&#39;m not spared of these covid rules which, no matter how you put it, it sounds like an attempt to keep the mosquitoes out by building a wire fence."
3607,more like &quot;we will make it necessary for profits and control&quot;
3608,"I&#39;m just looking at the numbers available on google - various countries of our western civilization. And I cannot see that great effect of vaccination. Some countries with ~60-70% rate of fully vaccinated have new records of new cases (like Germany). Australia being totally locked down is a kind of disaster. What a surprise that Sweden looks great. It makes me wondering - generally we have more than 50% vaccinated ppl but many countries have new records of infections. Statistically, it should not happen. Of course the virus is a bit different than year ago and the vaccines are also not up to date (sth like with flu virus). All of this looks like a kind of chaos and mistake with no clear evidence of what works and what does not which leads to more and more restrictions and limiting people rights...everything without clear evidence and results. They were saying that we just needed to take a vaccine and everything would get back to normal state."

I understand it could be a shortage of authentic photos, though.<br>It&#39;s true that self employed people in South Korea have been suffered from the loss of their income due to the restriction, overall, the government has been dealt with well.

I live in Seoul and yes there definitely have been mistakes,  some restrictions stronger towards certain groups/businesses, but overall, Korea (government included) has done well compared to most countries.  We&#39;re at 76% fully vaccinated (2 shots), 92% of adults have at least 1 shot ..they  started the boosters not long ago."
3691,No one &quot;beats&quot; covid. Its just a matter of it it&#39;s well managed or not.
3692,South korea done pretty well of handling a covid 19 pandemic main reason is people follow covid precautions their wear mask in outside and vaccination rate and right responses

3699,Kudos to this nation that&#39;s cares for it&#39;s neighbors.

3705,Taiwan and south Korea has done well because of mandatory masks policy.. WEARING MASKS CORRECTLY indoors and outdoors even you had 2 jabs. Wuhan viruses is Not a normal viruses.

3711,South Korea did really well. they were very strict when needed and they were successful. <br>Low numbers of infections. <br>High number of vaccinations.
3712,Could it be that those countries are not testing as much as in the uk? Hence the lower rates?

3764,Nope it&#39;s not. That&#39;s one of the worst sample for fighting against Covid-19.
3765,Sweden is

3819,"Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Him. There is no other intermediary. May Jesus Bless you, trust Him, give your life - and He will take care of it :pray Convert yourself and believe in the Gospel - Romans 10 8-10 But what does it say? “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,” that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim: 9 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.  : Why this division, in the evil world we are in, we will be treated as objects and put to fight against each other. This is not what human life should be about. What is the point of wars, the constant enrichment of small units that they erode on the people they use in their plan. It is clear where this is going, we are only a pawn in the game and evil wants to use us for its purposes. There isn&#39;t much time left. No matter where you come from, who you are: Christ Is Waiting for you now. Wake up while there&#39;s still a chance. May God Keep u in His care. <br>An interesting thing about a disease that was created in laboratories by man. You don&#39;t remember any other flu: avian, swine, hiv virus that was also created by the human hand. The whole system of pharmacy [I recommend checking the meaning of the word pharmakeia] is not about treatment, but about stuffing the wallets of regular customers, leading them to death.  <br><br>it&#39;s all business, people do not mean night: just look at what is happening in the world. Evil has no friends, does not know what love or loyalty is - it fights against its own. How to overcome evil? A simple way: apply love to him and wait for reactions. Evil doesn&#39;t know what it is, the easiest way to deal with the problem.  [MT 24] And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. 5For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. 6And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. 7For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. 8All these are the beginning of sorrows. 9Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake. 10And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. 11And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. 12And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. 13But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. 14And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. [...] <br>Christ is more powerful than the evil that now rules in this world. &quot;<br><br>Remember that I have won the world &lt;3&quot; Jesus Is Coming - rejoice, the Lord Is near. <br>Just a moment longer and the Bridegroom will come and take His Bride"

3822,The biggest lesson we all learned is not to trust Doctors and not to trust the media.
3823,"Inspiring, Mr President. You navigated these deliberate stumbling block questions posed. I expecially liked how you made the issue about TRIPS and domestic vaccine production clear. &quot;If there is no agreement on matters of life and death, what other agreements can we have&quot;. Resources trade?. I think it is imperative that Europe begins to understand that there are other potential partners waiting in the wings and they longer have a monopoly. I think it is acceptable to accept no deal than one that stinks. Return home and let the people know the outcome of the negotiations and then seek alternatives. This may not be the optimal outcome but a necessary derivative."
3824,As usual &quot;want&quot; and &quot;crumbs from the table&quot;?? This sounds so familiar. All the monetry &quot;crumbs&quot; did not end up on the table but rather in private pockets.

3844,"Gary here -  wrong CR u eat steak,crayfish, caviar - the ppl get the crumbs."

3847,Gimme gimme gimme. <br>Same old story.
3848,"He asks this of Europe, yet not China....a snake if i ever saw one."
3849,"President Ramaphosa is right. Human good is infinitely more important than anyone&#39;s profit. The good that will come from every country being included in the TRIPS waiver includes ALL countries.  As long as covid exists anywhere,  we&#39;re all less safe. All countries need the ability to research and manufacture vaccines, using the knowledge already arrived at."
3850,A real man of the people. Also a billionaire...
3851,Let AFRICA breathe!
3852,"Ah, mighty south Africa; how you have fallen."
3853,EUROPE IS BROKE

3855,Aa Ramaphosa the people of Mali shouldn&#39;t be forced to accept France they clearly stated it that they don&#39;t want them in their country .
3856,They’ll send it straight to Beijing...
3857,"Lifting the patents is no solution like doing nothing is no solution. It only means more Countries with no money will have to fight for resources. As a German i support Factory Hubs on the African Continent 50/50 Partnership and African Jobs. But some African Leaders unfortunately already proofed that they are willing to sell everything to the Chinese or shut down operations if the private money for them fits, even if its against their own countries interest. Not saying that some western countries did the same. However its not a one way road. Zuma plundering his country while making claims of &quot;western colonization&quot; was the biggest joke."
3858,Yes of course you dont want crumbs. You want the whole have the whole cake. Never ending story.
3859,His name is. Puppet.

Several outbreaks were caused by pilots that did not follow the rules and tons of Taiwanese were dead because of that. So the strict virus control policy is widely supported by the locals. I would say the pilots and their families were the super minorities and their situation should be represent the majority of Taiwanese people. Let alone it was the time when Taiwan couldn’t get enough vaccines due to the interfering of China and most Taiwanese people weren’t vaccinated. It would lead to sudden surge of infection cases and huge loads of hospitalizations and death if the government simply released the restrictions to “ comfort the pilots and flying crews”. Btw the Taiwanese government did try once , relaxing the measures to serve the pilots needs, and that ultimately led to the first outbreak of the infection in Taiwan. <br>I knew that DW has a crew and some reporters here in Taiwan and I honestly hope that you don’t  sacrifice your sense of the public opinion here just to play with the “ left-leaning” sense of DW ."

3919,I&#39;ve yet to meet an African who is worried about COVID-19 vaccine supplies
3920,"Good idea. Particularly the mobility aspect. Although Africa keeps complaining about the lack of vaccines, hardly any country over there does sufficient testing or records Covid deaths. If you look at the stats, most of Africa is hardly impacted😉by the virus. Even in South Africa where the tracking is excellent and the threat obvious, there is major vaccine hesitancy, so imagine what the uptake will be in countries where people don&#39;t believe they are at risk. Once the limited number of vaccines that will be of interest is administered, the container can be moved elsewhere."

3968,"The explanation of what is happening and why:<br>Under capitalism, all crises are crises of overproduction (for details, see the third volume of Marx&#39;s &quot;Capital&quot; or the chapter &quot;Economic Crises&quot; from the textbook &quot;Political Economy&quot; (1954, K. Ostrovitianov). Solvent demand lags behind the rate of production, the market becomes saturated, many commodities are unsold. This collapses the prices of these goods and, consequently, the profits of the owners of production. <br>To save their profits, under the guise of a &quot;pandemic&quot;, global financial capital pursues the following goals:<br>1. Reducing/compressing production by shutting down production sites, moving enterprises to a part-time working week, &quot;quarantining&quot; workers without pay etc. (this is done to allow old goods to gradually dissipate and suspend the production of new ones). <br>2. Physical destruction of &quot;surplus&quot; products that cannot be sold (think of the destruction of millions of livestock, millions of tons of milk, vegetables, fruit, Dutch mink, etc., in 2020, under the pretext of the &quot;pandemic&quot;). &quot;Swine flu&quot;, &quot;bird flu&quot; and the &quot;African fever of swine&quot; are used for the same purpose - getting rid of &quot;surplus&quot; products in the food industry (also bankrupting the smaller producer).<br>3. Forcibly inflating commodity prices to compensate for the losses and to stop them falling as a result of overproduction, creating scarcity and hype<br>4. Hiding the fact that supply chain disruptions are the result of factory shutdowns (see 1) and other anti-crisis measures of capitalists<br>5. Labor force reductions. In order to hide the very fact that there is a colossal crisis requiring an unprecedented number of layoffs, in order to make money on &quot;vaccines&quot; and save on layoff payments, capitalists force hired workers to get &quot;vaccinates&quot; or to resign voluntarily by giving them the ultimatum of not being allowed to work without being &quot;vaccinated&quot;<br>6. The elimination of small and medium-sized enterprises (i.e. smaller capitalists), to occupy their niche in the market<br>7. Reducing state budget expenditures (which under capitalism are at the disposal of the largest monopolies) on the social sector (primarily education and medicine).<br>8. Fighting against the growing protest wave and revolutionary upsurge caused by the crisis and measures undertaken to combat the crisis; this fight is carried out by demoralizing the population, banning gatherings, putting muzzles on people&#39;s faces, making it difficult to communicate, etc.<br>9. The intensification of economic exploitation (cancellation of benefits, bonuses, non-payment of salaries, prolonged working hours, reduction of benefits)<br>10. Inventing new sources of profit and forcing products on millions of people that they don&#39;t need (e. g., &quot;hygiene masks&quot;, &quot;vaccines&quot;, PCR &quot;tests&quot;, medicines for &quot;covid treatment&quot; and various other &quot;covid&quot; equipment). By means of government contracts at the expense of the budget, billions of dollars in extra profits are pumped into the pockets of the largest capitalists.<br>Note, that the &quot;climate crisis&quot; is another disguise of all of the above-mentioned economic measures."

3977,"I’m unvaccinated and I’ve visited Germany twice in the last 6 months. I was able to get into Germany because I showed proof of full recovery. I’ve had the delta variant twice and it was extremely bad, there was a couple of days when I thought I wasn’t going to live to see the next day. I’ve had omicron twice and it wasn’t bad at all; a bit of discomfort for about 3-5 days and it was gone. I visited Munich late last year and even with the covid restrictions the local businesses there were very lax with enforcing the mandates. I was just in Heidelberg 2 weeks ago and that city was very strict with whatever mandates there were. As long as I can travel without getting the vaccine then I’ll travel. It’s time for us to start living again instead of simply existing."

4049,How can you force your own country. Sounds hilarious when you say force. It’s like we’re saying we forced Alaska to lock down
4050,"Xi is not to force HK to lockdown, is about to mobilize mainland China to support HK, therefore, more medical teams and supplies will be delivered to HK as soon as possible, Shenzhen hospitals are standby to treat covid patients transferred from HK . <br>To lockdown a city is a decision suggested by  covid medical experts, HK leader addressed that lockdown is unnecessary,  means the covid is still under control."
4051,"Economy, economy, economy, economy"
4052,"We are only as strong as our weakest link. Delta, Omicron and a huge transfer of government funds to the US pharmaceutical companies won’t have occurred if the likes of the west and India decided to do the right thing and stopped preaching misleading ways of curbing the spread a the start of the pandemic. How the Western media and governments caused a prolonged bout of the pandemic from a possible of months to 2 years… Singapore admit defeat ages ago, but China and Hong Kong are still trying their best. Luckily Asians normally practice sensibility whether it’s China, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan or South Korea, shouldn’t have to worry too much, all the best to them! 🙏<br><br>For those who think i am an anti vaxxer, my family and close relatives have had 3 doses, yet 3 passed away after 3rd dose. Myself 2nd dose last year yet caught covid 1 1/2 month later. Don’t put your hopes too high on the vaccination. Keep working hard on staying fit, your own immunity is probably the best way to fight through this now."
4053,There you go.Dynamic 0 for hong kong.
4054,Oh my🙏💚💙♥️
4055,Taiwan is in the same boat.  Zero covid is not sustainable.  Taiwan will similarly have a  huge wave if and when it decides to open.

4063,So much people u know why u need to put coronavirus and omicron
4064,Taiwan can help!?
4065,I just wonder why inviting an correspondent from Taiwan to discuss the issue about Hong Kong. It’s that prove no freedom of the press in HK?
4066,Do you guys not know that Hospitals in Hong Kong is already flooded with patients? many of whom are waiting outside due to lack of space and beds inside?<br>How are you guys not acknowledging the urgency and kept talking about politics?

Actually the fact here in Hong Kong, we think the Hong Kong government act too slow, Chinese government work way more efficient then the Hong Kong Government, a big portion of local people urge the government to seek for expertise from China government ."

4095,"DW: if HK is not locking down, it must be that CCP doesn´t give a shit about the lives of Hong Kongers!<br>Also DW: if HK is locking down, it´s CCP violating HK´s freedom!<br>So DW, in your opinion what should CCP do exactly to satisfy u lol?"

4119,I am 28 n had COVID in April n suffering from Post covid ITP since then
4120,I hope not to experience this but I am doing well so far back to my best after recovering from COVID almost two months ago while double vaxxed. This sounds scary already. Hopefully they will find the solution to this problem soon

Thankfully, the scientists have worked hard to get the vaccines ready in record time which has substantially lowered the death rate. In any case, a pandemic would last for 2-3 years before becoming endemic, either with an extremely high death rate (as in the case of the Flu in 1918-1920) or with a much lesser death rate (as in the case of this one in 2019-2022)."

4400,"Not really, gonna be a surge coming soon 😑 real soon 😑"
4401,"***What I am about to say is simply my opinion and not stating fact.<br><br>     Let me start with 20 years ago. My then wife suffering from SLE, an immune disorder, and I had twins. <br>Any time one of the twins had a sniffle, runny nose, cough, etc... she would just stuff them full of baby medicines.<br>I get the maternal instinct to comfort your children, but in my opinion it was too much.<br><br>     Perhaps her mother did the same, but my parents never coddled my sisters and I when we had a sniffle our cough.<br>my parents would just &quot; Keep an eye on us &quot; and monitor. If things worsened, they took action. I would catch colds or<br>flu and my parents would make me stay in bed and watch tv. my mom would come in from time to time to check<br>my temperature and give me chicken soup. To this day, I am rarely sick. The last time I had the flu was 1996, and I never <br>get the flu shot.<br><br>     Anyway, back to my then wife...she would simply over do it with the medicines on our children and I kept telling her<br>to let them fight through it but monitor the symptoms and fever. She thought I was cruel and uncaring. She acted like<br>I wanted our children to suffer. I told her that I do care and I certainly do not want them to suffer, however, our newborn children&#39;s<br>immune systems are still in the developing stage and if you have all these medicines to do the work of<br>their immune systems....their immune system will not develop, and they will always seem to be sick.<br><br>     This is pretty much what is going on with this Covid thing. If we are wearing masks everywhere, social distancing, <br>sanitizing our hands etc....aren&#39;t we pretty much doing the same thing ? weakening our immune systems ?<br>I am 57, almost 58 ( September this year ) and I do not wear a mask except where it is required. I have not had a sniffle<br>nor a fever the entire pandemic. The last time I was sick was 1996 with the flu. Statistically I should have got sick, but<br>I have not....and I believe it is because my parents allowed my immune system to develop. <br><br>.....Use it or lose it....."

4464,"Unfortunately for some they will always be more susceptible to illnesses.<br>It is hard to live with  medical conditions, however they have to take more care and precautions.<br>I Know they wish people would change their lives for them but that is not okay.<br>Life must continue on.<br>I wish him well and really surgest he wear appropriate mask, N95.<br>There already is multiple treatments available now and decades ago."

4466,I sincerely hope the world has learned the lesson and now we know what jobs are actually crucial for our survival and what are totally secondary or even useless.
4467,"I wish it could become the end, but not endemic. I have been waiting since early 2020 and I haven&#39;t left out my hometown even one step. I do sincerely hope things will become normal soon. Wealthy countries should stop piling up their vaccines without giving to developing countries."
4468,"Endemic does not mean safe, it just means it&#39;s here to stay"
4469,Thanks for sharing...epidemic become a  indamic diseases ..that is meant it&#39;s become dangerous for whose they have lower immune systems capability... I hope healthy for all
4470,I&#39;d say as the viruses becomes an endemic again just be a little more aware of your surroundings and be thoughtful around others with keeping PPE wear always with you. The new times we&#39;re in we&#39;ll start experiencing new and more deadly viruses.
4471,I think the scenario didnt take into account the rate of infection and possibility of re-infection due to immunity wearing down. Vaccination is problamatic as well with distribution and production ( IP rights etc )
4472,"endemic<br>ĕn-dĕm′ĭk<br>adjective<br><br> 1. Prevalent in or limited to a particular locality, region, or people.<br> 2. Native to or limited to a certain region.<br> 3. Common in or inherent to an enterprise or situation."
4473,What could we refer to as endemic in the case of the Covid-19 pandemic?
4474,"If you look at stats for new cases its clear Omicron is much worse in some places while being more under control other places. So it&#39;s similar to insects swarming, like locusts, and that&#39;s likely how it will be from now on. If no other variant can outcompete Omicron, it will remain the dominant strain endemic globally, swarming in different locations relentlessly."
4475,"One thing we should definitely keep is a mask requirement on urban public transport. It really is a no-brainer. Even before the pandemic, I remember every winter in the metro was essentially voluntary exposure to the flu, which we would then track back to our vulnerable loved ones. How many deaths could have been prevented?"
4476,Small-pox eradication trulynwas an amazing feat for humanity.
4477,Poor nurses overwork….😢
4478,"When you get rid of those politicians and let the experts take control of the situation, then things will improve!"
4479,"Endemic does not mean low levels of infection, it means constant levels of infection.<br><br>So endemic covid could either be a constant low level of infection or it could be a massive sky high level of infection.<br><br>As long as it&#39;s constant then it&#39;s endemic. <br><br>Even if you vast piles of bodies mounting up, as long as the rate of infection is at a constant level then it&#39;s endemic."
4480,You know what they don&#39;t tell you? There are people still dying from almost every disease out there.
4481,"How can people evem compare covid with malaria? Malaria does serve as an example of what an endemic disease is, ok i get that, but bringing it up as an example of how an endemic disease is dealt with is unreasonable."
4482,"Keep alert. Infection in staff in food industry involves larger scale for longer duration. Industry gives off products at discount rates with free promotion. <br>Who will enforce Standard Certification? ISO, etc. Who will check food temperatures, pH, and method of preparation, transportation and storage."
4483,we live in a weird time. most of us will lose about 4 years of &#39;normal&#39; life by avoiding doing things because of covid.
4484,"It seems like this pandemic will end through multiple exposures for every human on Earth.<br>Vaccination then infection seems to give you the longest lasting immunity, safely. <br>COVID itself becoming less virulent is also helping. <br>Those with severe health issues.....my condolences."
4485,The same as with the flue. What a question.
4486,vaccines save lives! just got my booster shot :D
4487,Didn’t people predict that this would fail and be the wrong approach early on?
4488,"That&#39;s because, polio, TB, Small pox, the flu are different"
4489,"DW, do your research and tell us what happened to flu and pneumonia since March 2020. When you find and share the answer, back it up with empirical evidence."
4490,"Depends on whether or not enough herd immunity can be achieved to avoid overwhelming healthcare resources without behavioural measures otherwise behavioural measures will still be needed either voluntarily or mandated for some time or we will have secondary losses due to the lack of healthcare availability for every healthcare needs.  As we currently have regions that are at the cusp of overwhelming healthcare even with the current mandated measures, it would appear some behavioural measures either voluntary or mandated or simply allowing the healthcare system to be overwhelmed will be how managing the disease as endemic will be like.   Basically, if you want to treat the disease as endemic and relinquish behavioural measures, get vaccinated and boosted.  If you&#39;re not vaccinated, you have no right to be asking for measures to be lifted as you&#39;re the reason why we still need them."
4491,Fascinating word magic 👏👏👏
4492,"Hey, COVID-19 maybe you should think about the future COVID-19 virus!! 🙏 😷"
4493,"What is bothering me is that governments still have not come up with hard numbers for determining policy changes. I believe one of the reasons we have people protesting in Canada about vaccine mandates is that the government has failed to clearly communicate an endpoint when mandates will no longer be required. e.g. if we said we will stop caring if you put yourself at risk when hospitalization rate is down to x, and deaths is down to y, someone who is reluctant to be vaccinated might decide to wait it out instead of protesting if the numbers trend a particular way. At the same time, the government would be in a better position to justify restrictions in freedom by citing numbers either ticking back up, or failing to drop, and without setting arbitrary end dates, not knowing what conditions may hold."
4494,Bugger me another year. I have had my booster I&#39;m done. Between that and good immune system I should be right now.
4495,Theres no such thing as herd immunity
4496,Poor control of virus spread in other countries is called an epidemic. While poor control of the same virus in US and EU is called herd immunity
4497,Yes …lets keep distance forever. (From this guy)

4504,"I don&#39;t think so, considering how extremely contagious it is. Either it&#39;s gone or we all get it, over and over again."
4505,"Omicron has been a blessing:<br><br>1. Omicron&#39;s high transmissibility makes the extreme suppression measures look futile e.g. china. We have to face reality that it&#39;s inevitable everyone will be infected at some stage. <br><br>2. We have vaccines and were planning to boost/3rd dose when it emerged and they still work very well against severe outcomes in most even with Omicron. There was no need to update the vaccine/wait for a new one to become available. And there&#39;ll soon be a good antiviral available for those that need it as a safety net, which should still work despite the new variants. <br><br>3. The virus is quite possibly less pathogenic, especially if previously vaccinated or infected. In addition, it possibly prefers to stay in the upper airways instead of deep into the lungs where the virus causes problems.  <br><br>4. Population-level immunity is going to be significantly enhanced for the future, due to the shear number of infections/reinfections (hopefully whilst vaccinated/previously infected).<br><br>But, we shouldn&#39;t get complacent, because we might just have been lucky. Desperately need to focus efforts on global vaccine distribution, because this is how new virus variants have emerged so far, from low immunity and uncontrolled spread (not from being vaccinated)."
4506,"I think this pandemic has taught people the importance of multiple streams of income, unfortunately having a job doesn&#39;t mean security rather having different investments is the real deal."

4508,"Sitting at home in northern Germany… COVID positive since last Wednesday, first two days were a little unpleasant… then light cold symptoms… now the most frustrating part is waiting for the quarantine to finish… Myself and my whole family are infected… my wife and I double vaxxed, which we attribute to our quick recovery… we are done with this virus and happy to move on…"
4509,The pandemic will become endemic in specifically 67444233 days
4510,&quot;we haven&#39;t reached herd immunity so we decided to call it endemic&quot; 😂🤡
4511,"How about those in high risk category stay at home and rest of us get our pre covid lives back?   So I guess it’s vaccine, mutation, vaccine, mutation, vaccine, mutation and so on.  Then I have to ask how well test are the vaccines on mutations.  Also shouldn’t vaccines be updated so the current vaccine is a bit different to original vaccine instead of making people take 20 million doses of the same useless original vaccine?"

4656,As an Indian I support those truckers.
4657,"KEEP IT GOING!!! I am truck driver from Oregon USA, I would join you if I could. STAY SAFE!!"
4658,"One guy had a Confederate flag , and he was called out by the real Truckers     He was also wearing a ski mask to hide his identity.  The media forgot to mention that he was there to make trouble for the convoy.  Well done main stream media.  Bravo."
4659,"When BLM burned down stores, looted shops, harrassed seniors, that was okay and acceptable. But when truck drivers stand up for their own livelihood, it is facism. We are tired of this double standard. If you do journalism, do it faithfully."
4660,The movement is well funded and gaining more determination by the day.
4661,United we stand!!!! Let’s go!!!
4662,The so called &quot;havoc and grief&quot; was caused by the very politicians speaking against the truckers.
4663,All power to them!  They are fighting for freedom!  The state does not have the right to tell people what they can or cannot put into their own bodies.
4664,Hey let&#39;s appreciate that Canada has atleast become relevant!
4665,"GO CANADIANS, AUSTRALIA&#39;S WITH YOU!!!!"

4667,Dont give up on your freedom
4668,"When New delhi was paralysed for one year this Justin Trudeau came out and was telling indian government about how to deal with protests peacefully and protect the human rights of farmers<br>Now when it&#39;s his own turn comes now, then he has fled from Ottawa 🤣 and his mayor is talking about violence as an option to end the protest <br>Now why Trudeau is not protecting the human rights of truck drivers of his own country??"
4669,These mandates are against human dignity!<br><br>Support from Austria! Together for freedom!
4670,Eighteen wheels to flatten the curve 🇨🇦
4671,"Hold the line folks. S/o to Vive Frei, Ottawalks, Machines Everywhere 🦾"
4672,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZBmhlkcg3o&amp;t=2m05s"">2:05</a> Absolutely right... people must ask post soviet union countries what is not to be free or if they ever had Freedom of Choice."
4673,"These truckers are protesting in form that is non destructive in comparison to the BLM movement. It comes to show the unity among Canadians, which is barely seen throughout the country. If it were a protest about any other thing would they get the same treatment?"
4674,"This should not go on for months and months, this gentleman is right! Can someone please tell Trudeau to come out of his bunker and speak to the people? And listen to them? BTW  This mayor was also awarded BEST COMMUNICATOR In 2014...IMAGINE THAT!!!"
4675,I got the vax because I felt coerced. I&#39;m sure many of the truckers did too.
4676,This is the capital city they have every goddamn right to be there to protest and It don&#39;t matter how goddamn long it takes
4677,long live these working class heroes
4678,&quot;Loud minority&quot; they say...
4679,"Thank you so much for covering this important piece of our history.  PEI, Canada"
4680,"Today’s news is that the reprehensible Canadian government is demanding that people in the US stop supporting the Freedom Convoy. Tough luck fascists! We Texans Stand behind the brave, bold, brilliant Canadian Patriots 1000%!! Keep on Truckin Freedom Convoy!!"
4681,"Today’s news is that the reprehensible Canadian government is demanding that people in the US stop supporting the Freedom Convoy. Tough luck fascists! We Texans Stand behind the brave, bold, brilliant Canadian Patriots 1000%!! Keep on Truckin Freedom Convoy!!"
4682,Europa levanto todas las restricciones sobre la pandemia porque Canadá continua con su política de imposición a sus ciudadanos…
4683,The USA is with you truckers
4684,Democratic countries need citizens to stand up for freedom  of choice.  CHOICE is the key word.
4685,"The older lady commenting said she was born after the second world war and they &#39;they&#39; don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like not to be free. Well considering you were born AFTER the war, you don&#39;t know anything about it either 🤣"
4686,Not an entirely true depiction of whats going on over there! 🤣
4687,I think  the  Convoy make mistakes  no Suppose  do this Protestant  now have to Pay a Lots Money and suggestions I&#39;m sorry  for this People recently commented  on my concerns the make I say a Lots  mistakes  about Gobierno 👍
4688,"I think the contra-protests are just afraid of crowds, when they see too many people on the streets, they assume that they are the trouble-makers, but those truckers are not. The grand nanny just wants to ‘feel safe’ in her own private zone, but does not really care about others safety or rights. Truckers are traveling around, Nanny only stays at home, who will have more accurate information, that is obvious. When we can’t go out to see the world, we don’t have any first-hand information. We just simply be influenced by mass media, social media, maybe the person we suppose to trust."
4689,"It looks like a peaceful protestvto me. I don&#39;t see any violence nor a minority. <br>100,000 protesters on across the country. <br>50, 000 trucks protesting.<br>Volunteers cleaning the streets and feeding the truckers with their children."
4690,Stand strong truckers for freedom
4691,The discription of the city being paralysed. Seems to be the key expression on MSN. Which is interesting.<br>Also many of these truckers are indeed vaccinated. The ones that are express freedom of choice. One brush does not fit all.
4692,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZBmhlkcg3o&amp;t=2m06s"">2:06</a> Apparently this half dead woman wants to make us feel what it is not to be free"
4693,Your protest must disrupt workflow/revenue generation of the mandator&#39;s top political donors or this will not end. Get Organized People!
4694,Just great !!! I&#39;m vaccinated 3 times and am sick of the restrictions !!!All the way with the protesters !!!
4695,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZBmhlkcg3o&amp;t=2m20s"">2:20</a> slightly important fact at the end there... there are more truckers who are vaccinated than Canadians!!! 😂"
4696,I always thought that a mayor had to have a legitimate reason to declare a state of emergency? I guess feeding the homeless and reducing daily crime on the streets is one of them.
4697,"It&#39;s not about what a majority wants. It&#39;s about minority rights, or is that not a thing anymore?"
4698,"Wow, such an emergency.... They&#39;re honking their horns..... The poor children"
4699,"Truckers can be a formidable force. That is why early in the COVID campaign they were designated <i>essential workers.</i> As the bottom third of society is continually being eliminated by attrition commensurate with the objectives of <i>Agenda 21</i> it was important to make truckers realize that they were not included in the category titled <i>useless eaters</i> and that they were exempt from the cull.<br>    <br>After all, those that remain need someone to haul in food, fuel, goods, etc."
4700,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZBmhlkcg3o&amp;t=1m20s"">1:20</a> &quot;All options on the table&quot; &quot;Some violence&quot; &quot;Force protestors to leave&quot;, how about you listen to what they have to say?"
4701,&quot;Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.&quot;   -JFK
4702,You can&#39;t expect an NPC to comprehend something like this in any way - sorry for you NPC!
4703,let&#39;s go trudeau💪💪💙💙💙❤️❤️❤️
4704,It&#39;s funny why almost all governments around world are acting like this...🤔
4705,"What they don&#39;t say is that there are a lot of people protesting that took the jab. I took the jab but I still support them, I took it because I was pretty much forced for my job."
4706,The counter protest was violent . Not the freedom convoy.
4707,So interesting its nice to hear from this channel
4708,"🤣🤣🤣 Confederate flag in Canada? What is that, Isn’t that an American flag?"
4709,TRUE NORTH STRONG AND FREE!  🇨🇦❤🇨🇦❤🇨🇦❤🇨🇦❤🇨🇦
4710,This is hilarious this makes me proud
4711,&quot;This cannot go on for months and months. This is causing such havoc and such grief.&quot; You mean like the mandates?
4712,"Snow will melt soon, government will still falter, our numbers will triple. Keep it going :)"
4713,Canadian prime minister poked his nose in internal affairs of my country India by supporting farmers agitation and now is time to reciprocate
4714,"There won&#39;t be violence if you drop the mandates, no strings attached.. everyone will just leave.<br>    Mr mayor is threatening violence."
4715,My brother is a trucker in Ottawa participating in the Freedom Convoy and he&#39;s vaccinated.  He&#39;s protesting the erosion of human rights in Canada.  We have the right to choose sovereignty over our bodies and lives! ✊ ✊ ✊
4716,"The mayor of Ottawa is a liar, the local media here has bean spreading misinformation. It is a peaceful protest, there is dance parties going on. There is lots of people looking out for each other and mingling with the locals. Hockey games going on in the streets. The mayor cannot force people to leave, and it is not very democratic to end a protest."
4717,Replace Ottawa&#39;s Mayor and Chief Police gor their mistakes
4718,You should really research a little more before making statements of hate and division.. The actions of a few(which there was two flags... And they left as soon as confronted) and as for the mayor.. Months! We have had years of Covid.. Time to regain freedom<br>If you are there you will see love/compassion- the city is not paralyzed...the truckers would bring business to local businesses if they were allow to be open..
4719,Lets Go Canada!!!!STOP COVIDFASIST!!!!
4720,And yet many more are protesting for the freedom of others.
4721,End the mandates and people will leave. SIMPLE.
4722,its not much of a protest if you dont out number the police
4723,Get your facts straight before you speak
4724,Just as easy as dropping the mandates
4725,"It can&#39;t go on for months and months... funny, you&#39;ve had us on lockdown for 2 effin years"
4726,Only the people can legally give mandates around here.
4727,Ottawa was not prepared for covid and is not prepared for this protest. It was much easier to lock everyone in their homes than fix the health system. <br>&quot;Hospitals can&#39;t cope with the flood of infected people&quot;. Lol. Hospitals in normal days could not cope with emergency room admissions. How many of you waited in line 6 hours just to get care for your occasional sickness?!
4728,I wonder if you had the same opinion about BLM occupying your city
4729,"Duh, whoever heard of a quiet protest?"
4730,"China should support these protests, just like west supported hongkong protest."
4731,I was there yesterday and the city is not shut down was very easy to navigate.
4732,Trudeau&#39;s father used the 1980 constitution to give power from Parliament and to the PM.Canada constitutional monarchy is required to take advice from only the PM. In UK  to take advice from Parliament
4733,Went from Minority Fringe to state of emergency in a hurry
4734,God bless Canadian people 🇨🇦♥️! No to tyrany!
4735,💪💪💪
4736,This is nothing like legal passive resistance.   No one has the right to prevent the free flow of traffic over an important bridge or artery moving goods and people.     Every sovereign country has the right to decide who enters its borders and on what conditions.    Anything short of this is a Blockade.       You cannot hold an entire country Hostage by your irresponsible actions just because you have the means to do it.
4737,That mayor is cool. He should bring in helicopter gunships from Brasil!
4738,I just see criminals using trucks to commit crimes in Ottawa.
4739,They are not a minority get your facts right
4740,These politicians couldn’t be more corrupt and morally bankrupt.
4741,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZBmhlkcg3o&amp;t=1m17s"">1:17</a> The mayor of Ottawa is being irresponsible for suggesting that violence is an option for disbanding this protest."
4742,Where there is risk there must be choice.  Stop the mandates.  Keep protesting!
4743,I will tell you why everyone is on bad mood: it’s because main stream news media like you exaggerated covid issue so much that normal people started loosing hopes in their lives.
4744,Being MANDATED to recieve something that is legally exempt from liability is absurd!
4745,What happens if you can’t afford the fines? Will you be jailed for refusing to take a medical treatment? No doctor in the world would risk their licence by forcing a drug or a medical treatment on a patient against their will or if under duress.
4746,Calling attention to injustices is only divisive between those who would rather close their eyes to them and those who have no choice but to see — whether from personal experience or compassion.
4747,"It’s no anti ax, it’s being deprived of body autonomy. It’s also against human rights."
4748,"Inviting an expert on bioethics and avoiding the fundamental question, but chatting about politics. Well played DW"
4749,When you force people to be violent (back them in a corner) it&#39;s your own fault. Government deserves what it gets.
4750,Because people see this being about total control over body and mind and they remember what freedom should look like.
4751,How can this be happening in Europe
4752,‘Inforced’ is not a word…perhaps you meant ‘enforced’
4753,Didn&#39;t something like this happen about 90 years ago.<br>In the same place.
4754,i will literally leave the country if it gets mandatory
4755,"This approach seems so wrong 😕.  I am vaccinated, but don&#39;t support mandatory vaccination. People must be given a choice. I anticipate a future of frequent social unrest."
4756,Imagine being forced to get a jab that doesn’t protect you or anyone else
4757,"Yeah, but who will even pay the fine?<br>They can&#39;t force you to pay, so how can they enforce anything.<br>I&#39;m not an anti vaxxer, but those who dont want it should have the right to say no"
4758,A &#39;fringe minority&#39; and yet no one is lining up at the bus.  But they supposedly need security 🙄
4759,Austria has become the laughing Stock of the world and as an Austrian i am laughing with the world.
4760,How are vaccines manditory for the people while releasing the data from the vaccines studies isn&#39;t manditory for the pharma companies?
4761,What is misinformation? The challenging of unproven facts.
4762,What a wonderful world...
4763,It is spelled Enforced.
4764,"This wouldn&#39;t stand up in a court of law, no chance! People of the World stand with Austria and freedom of choice."
4765,Remember when Austria forced people to take free “train rides”?
4766,Scary how people just line up ready to get whatever shoved into YOUR BODY not anybody elses its your right to say no to this crazy bs
4767,"US society is fragmented beyond repair. The ever widening division between conservatives vs liberals, vaxxers vs anti-vaxxers, pro life vs pro choice, etc is tearing apart US society. The beginning of the ending of this &#39;great show&#39; in America is about to be unfolded."
4768,It&#39;s like &quot;1984&quot;. Resist against this brutal violation of human rights!!!
4769,So from my expierence with Austrians I assume this will never be enforced. It really doesn&#39;t make much sense atm.
4770,"imagine getting an expert who favours only  one side  an argument,,, Fair reporting?"
4771,"So now I am selfish because I care more about my own health than my neighbors? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA  My obligation, my responsibility, my duty is to take care of myself. Let the neighbor do the same."
4772,Der richtige Englische wort ist “enforced.” Vielen Danke!
4773,Why everyone is in such a bad mood? 😂😂😂 This could be our &quot;Eat the cake&quot; moment.
4774,i love the title lol<br>why is everyone in such a bad mood
4775,If this man is a Medical Ethicist then we are all in trouble. Good luck!
4776,"DW is clearly sooo biased 🙄👎  / ‘My body, my choice’ is not negotiable."
4777,"I see the good doctor is spreading misinfo, the Mrna injections don&#39;t stop transmission or contraction of C19 so why the mandates ? Austria Austria Austria what have you done??"
4778,&quot;&quot;For the first time in history the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who refuse to take it.&quot;&quot;
4779,Historically Austrians and forced medical procedures on other people have been bad ideas. This is dangerous.
4780,"I am NOT an anti-vaxxer, but I AM against vaccine mandates. Especially since yesterday! Yesterday, I met a man who ended up in hospital for two weeks with kidney failure caused by a Covid vaccine. His kidney function went down to 15%! He ended up on a mild dose of chemotherapy, too! His kidney function has risen back up, but it is still 50% down on their normal function. So, my question is this: If vaccines are mandates, who takes responsibility when everything goes wrong?"
4781,First guy you interviewed wasn’t even Austrian.
4782,"Crazy… like skiing in the open air with a mask on, and taking a beer (no mask needed) in a fully crowded café filled with strangers.. oh wait, doesn’t make any sense"
4783,Because they are fed up with the Goverment interfering in matters that should be entirely up to them!
4784,The system is radical. Not the people.
4785,forcing people to take medicine wow
4786,"I am losing my job due to vaccine mandates.  I had adverse reaction to pfizer dose 1, 3 months of debillitating symptoms, now my doctor will not sign my exclusion waiver.  very sad.  no more shots for me."
4787,Fight back Austria! Fight back! You are not animals. This is wrong.
4788,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxNpCIMd-PY&amp;t=3m45s"">3:45</a>, they are not providing adequate health care since before covid-19"
4789,&quot;They have radicalized&quot; (said about the protestors). But vaccine mandate through law is not radical? The only law we need is a law that requires journalists to show proof of IQ.
4790,"You had a medical ethicist on and not ONE question about the ethics of forcing people to take a vaccine that is very weak at protecting against the virus, but comes with unknown long term consequences."
4791,"Hii Doctor, Am also facing ED after vaccination.. Its not bcoz of covid19, its bcoz of covaxin vaccine.. You can check with pre and post vaccination of covid patient.. Am very upset now.. Before vaccination i was getting 100% erection but now after one month also its not getting erected.. Pls help Doctor...<br><br>Top most doctors are not ready to accept this that due to vaccine peoples are facing ED.. then why there are so many videos uploaded on YT., peoples are facing it.. But government and DR are ignoring it.."
4792,"This is not a fair question, the ETHICAL basis is well established under the NUREMBERG CODE"
4793,"Inforced? DW, you really need to start paying your interns. It is &quot;enforced&quot;."
4794,Enforced....this is imbarrassing
4795,"Hi DW team!<br>Could you please make a video or comment on how to get &#39;Genesenen&#39; status after having Covid abroad? I tried to find this information, but it seems like there are no direct instructions :( I mean if I have a positive PCR test in English - is it enough? Or should I provide something more? Would be an antibody test be enough? Where should I upload my test or should I go with it to my Hausartz? It&#39;s so confusing 😫"
4796,"0 seconds ago<br>Madness, especially in time of weak omicron and vaccines not protecting from spreading virus. Same time they should’ve introduce law that you can sue government in case of averse reaction, permanent disability or death."
4797,And the award for asking the world&#39;s dumbest question goes to....

4804,"It’s not enforced, it’s FORCED"
4805,"The only mandatory thing for the Austrian people to do right now, is to overthrow such a government."
4806,Appalling from the Austrian government - Austria has taken a very dangerous and slippery decision - people in Austria should be extremely concerned at what’s happening to their freedom of choice.
4807,"This mandatory will start the fall of government, people are starting to protest. Canadians are protesting too and it is affecting their economy."
4808,Just prove the efficacy and help them to understand. If they have been dependent upon the medical scientific complex now would not be the time to refuse acquiescence.

4810,"This gentleman talks a lot of excellent common sense - especially regarding the &quot;negativity&quot; of &quot;social media&quot; - but for many people - this is about the only, and most effective way of making your feelings or views about your particular &quot;gripe&quot; known.  Politicians live in &quot;ivory towers&quot; and by and large are unapproachable - except when they want your vote."
4811,"Wake up, DW. We don&#39;t want any repressive measures, mandates and certificates. It&#39;s for our health, right? Then leave us alone. (The vaccinated are already protected. Or, aren&#39;t they?)"

4819,"its gonna bite back ,bad...."
4820,"Because in case of getting severe covid it distracts medical personel and resources from those vaccinated that requires medical attention for other reasons, just obligatory triple fees for helthcare and social security system for unvaccinated and let them decide. It&#39;s fair and it&#39;s freedom because  freedom comes with responsibility. You can even give those excess fees back in say 5 years if person  never comes to municipal hospital for treatment against covid. My friend in USA is a doctor with PhD but she&#39;s a foreigner and just got her work permit. She&#39;s still looking for a job. Therefore this money will help to provide jobs for young medics and build new facilities and this will actually work for for everyone&#39;s good."

4926,The Velocity of money has gone 2 all time low...so we will see less and less of the nation&#39;s wealth trickle down.
4927,"Nothing new but enhanced during the pandemic - this trend have been going on within the western world since August 1971 when the Bretton Woods agreement ended and all currencies became free floating and disconnected from gold (the Nixon shock). The saleries in proportion to GDP has been trending lower since then meaning that states and buisnesses have become proportionally richer and the salary working population equally poorer. Endless cornucopian money printing has lead to inflation in asset classes (real estate, stocks etc) but not in salaries and that explains the wealth gap. This has in turn lead to the rise of not only more powerful politicians and central bankers but the 99th percentile richest have acquired such wealth that they can influence politics not only for nations but globally - hence the rise of lobbies like the WEF. More inequality and less democracy has been a result of this trend on a global scale."

4937,"What is preventing the rich from paying extra money directly to their governments to reduce sovereign debts or to pay to world charities to help the poor countries to afford vaccines, better education or to support small businesses in the poorer communities?"
4938,"Nice one, you genuinely are trying to show how dire things of the countries and it&#39;s citizens. Economically and other aspects. At this time the future doesn&#39;t look good. First thing.

4939,This can never be fixed because you can&#39;t stop people from taking risk . And risk = returns. The greater the risk the higher the returns. Even if you put a 90% tax( which is tyranny and will stifle innovation) 10% of 300 billion is still 30 billion while the average american household networth is close to a million.

4969,"What could be done about the people with lower amounts of money? Raise the wages and don&#39;t let the rich just sit and amass wealth. There&#39;s no need to have over 5 billion dollars. That&#39;s plenty enough to start any business or whatever. <br><br>We need the small shops and everything that&#39;s not the huge stores to survive for the gap to better. Without small businesses much of the middle class will disappear, and the lower class workers that kept those small businesses running will be jobless. I know there&#39;s a surplus of jobs right now it seems, but it could be the complete opposite very fast. In probably a decade, there&#39;s going to be an economy collapse and many many people will be homeless. Then they&#39;ll have to fix the homeless problem and everyone will truly understand how awful it is to be homeless."

5079,"This is just naked partisan posturing by the opposition and selective coverage by DW, since it has an editorial disdain for Johnson.  It&#39;s absurd to call for a PM to resign over having a party during COVID, especially since he has done so much to keep things open and people free from government intrusion throughout the pandemic.<br><br>Johnson appears to have done good things for the UK, especially as it pertains to the COVID pandemic response.  It seems like he has respected the rights and freedoms of citizens more than Canada, Austria, Australia, Germany, Israel and many US states.  The PM refused calls to mandate vaccines, masks and avoided lockdowns.  <br><br>I hope he stays in power."

5082,"In Indonesia, we have a specific word for this. It&#39;s &quot;gotong-royong&quot;. The spirit of sharing and supporting each other to reach certain goal for greater goods. In the time of Pandemic, Indonesian riches have also been charitable donating large sum of money for Covid Relief. It&#39;s also said that more tips were given to the online food delivery partner. It&#39;s not about whether the government or officials not doing enough, it&#39;s whatever action, no matter how small, we as a member of community can contribute to help each other during this hard time."
5083,In my opinion: Don&#39;t close down the app after the pandemic. Develop it further into some flavor of populist crowdfunding. It could help small businesses get off the ground and flourish. Maybe include other currencies from neighboring countries or even all over the world. This thing has potential.
5084,Let’s all work together for the country and for the world 🌍
5085,We are used to government that doesnt perform well. So the solidarity mentality is built into our culture.
5086,"That is the reason why a country needs a fully functioning tax system, in which everybody pays taxes and the taxes are spread properly. A lot of the private citizens and small businesses in Indonesia do not pay taxes, because they think it&#39;s too much, or it would be stolen anyway. Therefore, the government do not have enough money to support its people. The answer to prevent corruption is not with evading taxes."
5087,"When people trust private sector to provide social safety net, there&#39;s something wrong with the system. Hope someone points this out and holds the govt accountable."
5088,Bravo Indonesia
5089,Outstanding. Let&#39;s hope it maintains integrity ✅
5090,"Interesting: typical bank still look at profit and &#39;policy&#39; , its such great project to help community and people wish to help.

5138,First comment!!!!
5139,"Anis really cares of his people,he deserve more then just a governor,jakartan really lucky to having him as a governor"
5140,"For every nurse like this one, I would like to see the media talking to a corresponding proportion of nurses who did vaccination before it was decided it is obligatory and the corresponding proportion of nurses who will only vaccinate due to the mandate. Or at least report on the facts such as how big of % of healthcare workers were vaccinated before the mandate, to put this nurse&#39;s view into perspective. <br><br>Giving an outlet to the loudest people does not represent the views of people fairly and gives people a false sense of knowing what the general views of the health workers are."
5141,Being MANDATED to recieve something that is legally exempt from liability is absurd!
5142,"How long can this story, that being vaccinated keeps you from spreading this illness be believed? My family was given covid by a double vaccinated couple who came to our house. Their very mild symptoms were not noticed. Another friend, a healthy man in his 40s, took a fourth dose on January 6th, is very sick today and has been all week. If these are my limited experiences, I am sure that everyone else is having similar experiences and yet every time I listen about potential mandates, I hear that they are for the safety of others. It is not true."
5143,"This compulsory vaccination legislation would create a lot of jobs for a lot of attorneys (especially those that sue at the Consitutinal Court and work in the field of human right protection so-to-speak) who would otherwise have meager number of clients and cases to work with, thereby creating the flow of money among people, and boosting up the GDP.  😎"
5144,"If the vaccine “is proven” to only help to lower severe symptoms but does not avoid people from catching and spreading it, then it should be a personal choice to make, shouldn’t it? I don’t understand why they want to force it… a vaccinated nurse can also catch covid and spread it…"
5145,"this covid or omicron thing is driving us nuts, it is also creating many dividing issues. hope we all can work together to end it."
5146,God Bless The Number Of New Diagnosed covid 19 Cases In Germany Are Reduced By The Fastest Speed. Bless Germany’s Patients Will Soon Regain Their Health. Stop omicron Spread In Germany✋<br>Bless Germany’s People Have Safe And Auspicious🌞🇩🇪✊✊✊✌️✌️✌️
5147,"How about Indemnifying the Vaccination? Inspite of so many mandates, no vaccine company is ready to cover the losses incurred by those who suffer long term losses due to Vaccination. So are these vaccines really safe?"
5148,"The Question everyone should ask is.<br>Do governments have the right to enforce medical treatments on it&#39;s citizens, regardless of the reason?"
5149,"In a nutshell:some old people are for forced vaccination,some younger people are against.but let’s not forget that more old people vote in elections,so go figure.."
5150,Recent studies clearly identified that transmission in health care settings is overwhelmingly due to patient to patient and not provider to patient. Or you can just fire all non-compliant workers and then let these same patients die from lack of healthcare staffing.
5151,"Not really.  You have to factor by population it should be France.  Population of France is only 68.39 millions people versus 83.24 of German population.  France average for past 3 days is around 440,000 COVID cases per day.  That&#39;s 1 in every 153 people. <br>Germany&#39;s average 3 days is around 175,510 COVID cases per day.  That&#39;s 1 in every 474. 🤷🤦‍♀️"
5152,&quot;It is a small rootless international clique that is turning the people against each other and preventing them from having peace.&quot;
5153,The cognitive dissonance of that nurse is just flabbergasting.
5154,"After vaccination but get covid, who can be responsible? Can you sue your government? After 100th vaccination into your arm, and sky high antibodies, do you get immunity?"
5155,‘We don’t want our nurses to give our patients covid’ even tho it’s still transmissible after u get vaxxed lol what

5162,Stand for your rights Sebine!!!  We all support you❤
5163,Homeopaty and she works in ICU? Fire her.
5164,Compulsory vaccination for healthcare workers is not new! Prior to commencing training you have to submit your vaccination history and bring them up to date. In addiction you must be Hep B vaccinated. So adding Covid 19 vaccination shouldn&#39;t cause this furor.
5165,I doubt it. They won&#39;t fired them. They need them.
5166,In Canada vaccinated health workers  spread Covid  and stayed working because short of stuff  which lived because of mandate.
5167,Personally I will not take Dr.Paula&#39;s medical advise if i get sick. Shame on you Dr. Paula.
5168,"how dare you question the white coat of science<br>oh let me get down on my knees and grovel at the white coat of science"
5169,"It is her personal choice. What’s the problem here?<br><br>Several jobs require vaccination if someone chooses not to make a job due to the requirements, that’s ok."
5170,You can still get it if your vaxxed and still spread it. It makes no difference. It was a vaccinated traveller who brought omicron to Australia!
5171,"A need for monthly subscription vaccine?  What happens after a Year? A droid zombie person?,,"
5172,Just let people decide what they want. Trust your people’s common sense and let them behave according to their own risk. Mandating will rarely change anything.

5174,Homeopathy? She loses all credibility right there.

5179,"Before mandating your healthcare workers, it&#39;s only responsible to do a risk assessment on<br>the benefits v  risk....<br>What are the long term risk of these treatments?"
5180,Do we need a booster?
5181,Typical view points no balance in your reporting.
5182,"That&#39;s why it&#39;s a silly idea to make the vaccine mandatory only for healthcare staff - make it mandatory in general, so people aren&#39;t pushed into leaving their job to escape vaccination. Often these types of half-measures are much worse than the alternatives of doing nothing at all, or going all in."
5183,War is not compulsory  sanctions is not compulsory.  People life  shelter &amp; food is paramount. <br>Politicians talk about sanctions. If sanctions no trading people will loss their job . No food on the table.  Not only your country many <br>Crime rate will increase.  Because of chump politicians

5187,Germany and other countries should try communistic approach in dealing covid. Chinas covid zero tolerance is working well.
5188,As much as I respect Sabines decision to not get vaccinated. I doubt her alternative therapy is very effective.
5189,No mandate
5190,😱😱😱
5191,Fight against tyranny!!!
5192,There&#39;s just something about Germans
5193,"Immunity, whether acquired by vaccine or naturally, is the only thing that matters to the virus.  It&#39;s unethical to mandate a vaccine for someone with natural immunity."
5194,on two occasions the reporter emphazes on vaccine safety. They are not. Check VAERS reporting system.
5195,I thought Germans were supposed to be smart and free from an oppressive goverment. I guess they like the feeling knowing the history..
5196,So she is on the front line for the last 2years and never cought it? Someone should study why not.<br>Giving someone medication against their will is a extremely dangerous precedent.

5204,WHY stupids are making for kids to compulsory attend school
5205,Look on the ‘belief’ of the ‘efficacy’ of the jab against omicron variant as an intelligence test….
5206,I chose to be vaccinated because it will protect me eventhough that isn&#39;t 100 %
5207,Yes listen to nurses... eventhough they have not been educated to understand vaccinations...makes sense
5208,Germay back at it again like the good old days
5209,It’s not putting the patients at any greater risk the fact of the matter is if you have the vaccine or not you can still spread COVID-19
5210,I am no expert but you will never vaccinate your way out of the pandemic. This not me saying this but alot of scientists and experts..
5211,Classic German mentality.
5212,Sop is important like wear mask 👈👈👈
5213,"Isn&#39;t it weird that the most vaccinated countries like Israel, France and USA are reporting the highest number of new covid infections, while the numbers have declined in South Africa which has only managed to double vaccinate about 27% of its population."
5214,FARTZ. <br><br>Just FARTZ.
5215,Not a very bright girl.
5216,Terrible framing.  Again. 👎
5217,How you can have some danger covid in Germany if we don&#39;t have any here in Poland? <br><br>HOW!?
5218,Her stupidity started with the belief in homeopathy XD
5219,"Guys, I got first covid probably (alpha,beta or gamma) which gave me 2 days of serious fever and almost 12 days of taste and smell loss. Later i got delta again, but it was 1 day fever and thats it. Just a couple of days ago I now got omicron, didn&#39;t got any fever except slight headache and some burning sensation on throat. I haven&#39;t had a single dose of covid vaccine, but it doesn&#39;t mean that everyone shouldn&#39;t too. Vaccine definitely works, my younger brother who had only taken 1 dose of pfizer was completely immune to omicron even though i suffered. It&#39;s unclear how long my body remembers this immunity with this inceasing levels of variants. BUT the thing remains is that I will not be taking any vaccine in the nearby future 😀😂"
5220,"This lady is brave.  Like her, I&#39;m not getting vaccinated for Covid and subscribing for monthly booster shots.  I don&#39;t belong in a high risk group."
5221,What do you think is happening?
5222,Live free?<br>Not for me.<br>I shouldn&#39;t have to say it twice.<br>The purpose of my own existence is to die a slave to Christ.<br><br>I am a slave of the Lord.<br><br>The world can have its freedom.<br>Its deception.

5230,Why is she not even wearing a mask when treating her clients? So wreckless.
5231,Compulsory???! Ummm.....what about the constitution??? What is the world coming to??
5232,This is awful reporting. You are normalizing an outlier all in search of views.
5233,"vaccination does not stop spreading, so how it will help?"
5234,I have been vaccinated in October. I have just finished recovering from COVID-19. Dumbest subject Ever :-D
5235,"Hey guys, viruses are subject of science. Ask to scientists, virologs, not to the people who are misinformed."
5236,"The fact mandating an experimental medical procedure is even being debated  is terrifying, especially considering the science just doesn&#39;t back it up."
5237,"Debate not necessary, just do it."
5238,"10 times as much as this lady needs her additional salary, does her employer need her support. Unfortunately, that&#39;s the sad situation in Germany. And the unvaccinated population are aware of this. The only way to tackle this situation is that the insurance provider should deny covering their hospitalisation costs when they are sick with COVID. Even basic consultation should be borne by the unvaccinated."
5239,Get vaccinated. What is the difference since most of us have been vaccinated to come this far. I really don’t understand all the fuss.
5240,Even omicron was sneaky... many people who had it had negative home tests.
5241,"I love DW News but this was funny. <br>&quot;How dangerous is it?&quot; <br>      &quot;Hard to say.&quot;<br>&quot;Where has this variant been detected?&quot;<br>        &quot;The places you said.&quot;<br>&quot;So should we be concerned?&quot;<br>        &quot;Don&#39;t know.&quot;<br>&quot;Understandable.  Thank you, have a nice day.&quot;"
5242,This new variant needs to be called Decepticon.
5243,The stealth variant can only be detected by tracing the flow of money to pharmaceutical companies
5244,"It&#39;s so stealth, people don&#39;t even know they have it. What a nightmare!"
5245,next variant will be able to use afterburner and thrust vectoring
5246,The fearmongering variant is the worst of all.
5247,"In a simpler time we would have concluded: the tests don&#39;t detect the variant, we need to improve the tests.<br>Now it is: we need to figure out the transmissibility (still using the defective tests) in order to decide if we should be concerned.<br>I am vaccinated and pro-vaccination in general but since Omicron has changed the risks and benefits, I become pro-sarcasm more and more."
5248,I love apocalyptic situations. Hope this goes on forever.
5249,"It is so undetectable, that people don&#39;t know they have it, but we need more restrictions and boosters and passports and segregation now....."
5250,Even omicron has been stealth... many people with it were getting negative home tests.
5251,This report was disappointing. In what sense is this variant more difficult to detect? Is it because it has a greater proportion or asymptomatic cases (so more people don’t realise they need a test) or are the current tests less accurate in identifying positive cases? This report should have explored this given the headline. What we got was poor questions to the expert resulting in uninformative answers.<br><br>Update: I have since learned from another source that the “stealth” variant of omicron is simply more difficult to identify as omicron as opposed to other variants. It is not more difficult to detect as Covid 19. It has mutated a protein on the spike which has been used to quickly identify omicron cases. It may be a bit more contagious than standard omicron but that is only a guess from the fact that it is spreading.
5252,I feel like this isn&#39;t going to end for years. It just doesn&#39;t feel likely.
5253,"The stealth variant has not been detected yet, be very alert."
5254,"the old joke was confirmed, the corona is such a serious disease that without a test it is impossible to determine if you are sick or not.  And now, with stealth technology, this cannot be determined even with a test...)"
5255,"It&#39;s not <i>hard to detect,</i> it&#39;s just that it doesn&#39;t look exactly like BA.1 on most PCR tests, but rather like Delta, due to its non-failure on the S-test. If a full genome sequencing is done, it&#39;s easy to detect.<br>Since it is just a little more contagious than BA.1 and not more pathogenic, <b>no worry.</b><br>Therefore it&#39;s just a VUI (variant under investidation) and not a VOC (variant of concern)."
5256,COVID has ruined my life and I’m not even sure if I ever caught it. Measures and restrictions have ruined my life…
5257,"People are asymptomatic and tests don&#39;t detect it, but we need to broadcast it in a way that makes people afraid. .."
5258,Why aren&#39;t any of these countries put on a &#39;red list&#39;? South Africa was so quickly disregarded when detecting omicron.
5259,I don’t have any symptoms so I possibly have the stealth variant. I need to isolate myself for a month I guess. In the Maldives.
5260,"the stealth variant is so difficult to detect that we are unable to detect it,  but we will give it a name because name submission deadline is here."
5261,"As I know: PCR detect only some small sequences of Molecules which are already known before. PCR have never detected complete, virulent and replicable Viruses."
5262,What happened to the common cold in the last 2 years?
5263,"The &#39;stealth omicron subvariant&#39; (BA.2) is the &#39;alpha variant&#39; of the original &#39;omicron coronavirus&#39; (BA.1). While alpha, beta, gamma and delta are variants of the original virus found at Wuhan, the BA.2 is a variant of the BA.1, which is a descendant of a variant of the original virus found at Wuhan called B.1.1.529, after it has been &#39;remanufactured&#39; by the mice. So AMOF the BA.1 descends directly from another mammalian species (a rodent), as much as the original virus found at Wuhan descends from the pangolim. Each time the virus jumps to another species it suffers significant mutations and resets its capabilities which seems to prompt it to infect other species... BTW this seems to be the reason the researchers were not able to find exactly the SARS-CoV-2 in so many bat species they have analyzed in Asia: it&#39;s just after staying for a while on a new species that the virus re-establish itself as a &#39;new virus&#39;... Now imagine what the future will bring us if the virus keeps jumping into other species and jumping back again to the humans..."
5264,hard to detect?<br>It is true that delta and the B.a.2 give the same response in tests.  However once omicron Pushes delta out in a few weeks it is easy to tell ba1  and ba2  apart.
5265,"This is getting crazier by the minute.<br>PS.: Meanwhile sadly its a proven fact that this whole thing was very patiently, meticulous<br>planned,facilitated and realised by a group of very rich &quot;philantrops&quot; to make their philantropical<br>endeavours -  way - more profitable and change society in one bold move more to their liking.<br>Nicely done,i given them that."
5266,When no one knows anything about the new VARIANT they should not say a word.
5267,A stealth variant but being discovered is not very stealthy
5268,Serious question: So it&#39;s basically the same as the common cold now?
5269,First two weeks of 2022 we had a surge here in the Philippines and it is a mix of omicron and flu cases. Went to the pharmacy the other day and no long queues of people buying paracetamol and cough medicine which tells me that were in a better state now and then here comes another variant. I dont think we will have stabilized situations now and in the next few years due to the new variants. Even if restrictions were lifted we dont feel safe going out at all. 🤦🏻‍♀️
5270,I’m unvaccinated and got Omni one bad night of fever and a headache.a day later mild headache.I’ve never had a headache or the flu in my life.
5271,Awsome. A new boost needed. We are flattening the curve!<br>Let&#39;s go Brandon.
5272,When are people going to realize that all viruses mutate. And what happened to the regular flu/cold season?
5273,More than COVID I fear those drilling techniques in my nose used by nurse during sampling 😂😂
5274,Appearing around the world at the same time...looks like the boosters are working as planned.
5275,They miss spelled it … it’s actually the BS.2
5276,Isn&#39;t this b a.2  detected b4 omnicrom and considered not a concern at all?
5277,I had the omicron. For some reason I thought the shots would protect me but it was only to protect you if you got thr first Corona not the varient 😑
5278,"This one is BA 2 variant, the next one will be F-35 variant. This madness has got to stop man, it’s getting ridiculous by the second for real."
5279,"Imagine virus so deadly and dangerous, that you have to try really hard to make it look that way.<br>The struggle is real..."
5280,Can&#39;t say I know any more about BA.2 than I did before I watched this.
5281,"The professor didn&#39;t mention which vaccine to take, we have a number of experimental vaccines doing the rounds currently. He also didn&#39;t say anything about previous infections, or natural immunity...<br>Also non of the experimental vaccines, stop transmission, so what treatment was he talking about ?"
5282,The real question is.   <br>   If every one gets gets brake through Omnicron will we all get break through  BA 2 ?   <br>  How did it get that name? Is it short for &quot;Bad A?? 2 .&quot;
5283,I like stealthy builds. Could become my favourite variant. 👍🏽
5284,I want to hear more stories about the monkies that was released in North Carolina in America. I heard it was an airborne form of rabies. A woman was taken to the hospital after being hissed and the story died...
5285,Thanks for keeping us informed
5286,I dont get it... If it is so hard to detect... How could they detect it precisely in some countries ????
5287,"Who’s “struggling with omnicron” most experts say it’s a gift to obliterate actually more dangerous versions such as delta. <br>The cats out the bag, media needs to stop hamming things up."
5288,"Wondering why we have this report, which took several minutes to could have been delivered in 30 seconds."
5289,"So stealth......but yet confirmed identified 48 Spikes(omicron) ......tested negative during day 1 to day 845, showed no symptom.........died in hospital at age 90"
5290,there are well over 200 covids out there.  how many of these &#39;variants&#39; are just different versions of the common cold?
5291,"So a new variant has appeared, called BAA, with symptoms so mild that it can only be detected by going looking for it in healthy individuals.<br>🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
5292,"Variantes surgindo em ambientes de Alta vacinação. E o especialista sugerindo   mais  vacinação para conter variantes, mas a carga viral do vacinado é a mesma do n-vacinado. A solução então são infinitas doses? <br>Mas as mesmas não são atualizadas na mesma velocidade de geração de variantes. Ainda assim, a solução é vacinar pessoas saudáveis e forma obrigatória...🤷🏾‍♀️<br>A conta n fecha!"
5293,What we really need is something to protect us from the vaccines
5294,"To quote a doctor from Uganda interviewed on Dr. John Campbell&#39;s channel, &quot;Omicron is the vaccination we failed to create&quot;."
5295,It was funny when the host’s reaction was “Okay…”
5296,"New variant, new Billions....lucrative business. <br><br>Please keep dropping more variants and super vaccineboosters, we the people need our shots on a regular...thank you"
5297,"There are many other variants around, but one is picked to star on the science and media. The scientists that report new virus have their name noticed and written down on a gold book."
5298,This professor needs to do his homework a bit better; the current non-sterile vaccins do not stop the spread at all. Rather the opposite; they promote the faster rise of more new variants and sub-variants. We need to stop 🛑 the hyper focus on vaccins as the sole option and look at other ones as well.
5299,I am just waiting for the nuclear variant. That would put us all out of our misery i guess.
5300,Prof Tobias must have a PhD in saying nothing consequential
5301,"Covid-19 feels like an app rn...it releases lite version, bug fixed version, beta version of itself every month."
5302,"Can&#39;t wait for the ninja variant. All seriousness, I know the virus is very dangerous, I hope anyone reading this stays safe and takes care."
5303,"Omg, the irony of the $tealth variant. Any symptoms are now covid no exceptions anymore.. 😂 😆"
5304,"Expecting BA 0.2 to be more powerfull and effective, Shame on Omicron, Was not able to do much"
5305,My god to plz stop with more variants 😭
5306,Guaranteed it&#39;s already in Canada. Not that I&#39;m too concerned as both times I caught the virus I was asymptomatic.
5307,"How come their is no bio-hazard bins for the old face masks? It&#39;s so infectious and all, shouldn&#39;t there be bins to place these infectious masks into, rather than them blowing around the streets. I see used masked discarded every where. I keep looking out for them bio-hazard bins, but haven&#39;t seen one yet. Let me know if you see any please...."
5308,A disease with no symptoms that is also undetectable.....that&#39;s called being healthy!!!!
5309,the stealthy variant has untivaxx air to body missiles
5310,"On Jan. 22, 2022, the national news stated that the stealth variant had been detected in the US."
5311,"Keep travelling people, keep it up...and this will NEVER be over!"
5312,"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5r6UJsgqLw&amp;t=0m08s"">0:08</a> -  I love how when the prime minister tries to adjust the microphones, they don&#39;t cooperate. Seems like a familiar theme."
5313,"Unless you go in lockdown for a month, welding people into their houses, there is no getting away from these weak variants people don&#39;t know they have."
5314,I need to continue working remotely.  Bring on the variants please
5315,Optimus Prime Will be the worst variant.
5316,"Thus explains my recent illness, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m exaggerating or what but from the very first variant in early 2020, I&#39;ve fallen mildly sick just before every other variant was detected."
5317,Does anyone really care anymore? My 4yr old daughter had to have a week off school with Covid (along with ⅔ of her class) she has literally sneezed in my mouth and I haven&#39;t tested postive!! She showed absolutely no signs of being ill.
5318,"I believe  people that are boosted, vaccinated, and get breakthrough infections could that be the key to a different mutations because humans are getting sick and mutating with the common viruses that we pick up that mutate with this virus to make it another new strain of virus could that be possible"
5319,This is exactly why the 8th shot will definitely maybe protect you… <br><br>Someone
5320,The jury is still out on this variant...the verification of its presence is determined by how many people will be scared into complying...lol 😎
5321,"Otoh, I like that you are keeping us up=to=date with the latest news.  Otoh, I don&#39;t like the fact that there&#39;s yet another variant -- so I don&#39;t know whether to like this post or not."
5322,It&#39;s never going to end there gonna try and keep this going
5323,How were they able to track it when the virus is in stealth mode
5324,"Is it possible that the new variant is the as we called it &#39;healthy&#39; before 2020? stealth, no symptoms, undetectable."
5325,What do you expect when several EU countries are abandoning Covid protocols and mandates.
5326,Next variant Will be invisible and imagenarie ...
5327,Oh come on! How hard would it be to add &quot;d&quot; to the new varient. Then it would be the BAd 2 varient 😂
5328,The virus that keeps giving..never ending nightmare 🙄
5329,Stealth Omicron! That sounds so cool I want to catch it.
5330,"How to detect? ...<br>When it is spoken about it, from a certain government business corporation to market its products..."
5331,"Has light or no symptoms, hard to detect, spreads regardless of all measures. I know, let&#39;s PANIC and do everything costly and useless to SLOW THE SPREAD 🤪"
5332,"When the π variant appears, they will shutter all the bakeries. This will happen on 3/14."
5333,You know the pandemic has reached another level when you wake up from be with your mask still on.... 😅😅
5334,"I had several COVID PCR&#39;S and RAPID TESTS, all results are negative but I have the Omicron symptoms!!!! So very weird!!!"
5335,Remember these days where we weren&#39;t able to distingish virus variants and subvariants and whatsoever - and simply had a cold...
5336,Chinese government really working hard on making new variants of Corona 🤣
5337,Over it there will always be variants…..
5338,Stealth variant🥺
5339,"Variant after variant within weeks, who&#39;s gonna care... does the media not have any common sense to realize people won&#39;t be able to keep up with this hysteria much longer?"
5340,When did 72% become &quot;only&quot;? At the start of the pandemic this number was spit around as a threshold which should be enough
5341,The peoples of Austria hav a right to fight that decision
5342,"Common, it is a long tradition in Germany to expose people to  medical experiments against their own will."
5343,"To financially punish someone for not getting it, that&#39;s not going to end well..<br>Poverty and displacement, so then what do Austria do to deal with that?.  The country still remains in the same place, just with people in dyer situations.<br>That&#39;s a nice thing to do to your people<br>Brilliant 👌"
5344,This is a downgrade for human democracy today. I hope Austria fights this tooth and nail. This is against human rights.
5345,"The people don&#39;t need government permission to live, leave the people alone."
5346,Spain - way to go!!! 💪🙌❤️
5347,"Praying for Austria, way to go Spain!"
5348,"I know a little about the background to the reasoning in favour of compulsory vaccination in Austria yet it is an extraordinary move, and what is more startling is the level of support within the legislature for this initiative. Were the alternatives given adequate consideration? What of the potential backlash?"
5349,Don&#39;t be fooled. The money will never reach the poor. Another big payday for South African  politicians and their family members.
5350,CONGRATULATION SPAIN!!!!! They should make a statue for who decided to stop this circus!!!
5351,Spain is correct- Globalisation made this an endemic after year 1 when all flightsand international tourism resumed around the world continued.
5352,"No fear in Spain. Dont care anymore, tired. Cant say the same from other EU."
5353,Spain🙌🏾 Salute
5354,Austria&#39;s parliament needs to be redone!
5355,Spain finally regaining concise
5356,Why would they do such a thing when they know that they can&#39;t stop anyone from catching or transmitting the virus.
5357,"wow Austria, wow"
5358,"I guess I am a Spaniard!  Eff Covid.  Live your life.  If you are compromised with medical conditions, be very careful.  If you are overweight, you better be careful."
5359,"Hii Doctor, Am also facing ED after vaccination.. Its not bcoz of covid19, its bcoz of covaxin vaccine.. You can check with pre and post vaccination of covid patient.. Am very upset now.. Before vaccination i was getting 100% erection but now after one month also its not getting erected.. Pls help Doctor...<br><br>Top most doctors are not ready to accept this that due to vaccine peoples are facing ED.. then why there are so many videos uploaded on YT., peoples are facing it.. But government and DR are ignoring it.."
5360,all govt is trying to break democracy instead of discussing it with people.
5361,It&#39;s not about health it&#39;s about control for many countrys
5362,"All I see is these politicians one after the other... having their hands all over that podium, and I cringe to think of how that alone spreads this virus"
5363,"Either we fight it all together, or let it go on, forever..."
5364,Humans will look back at this era  and ask WHY????
5365,Hope they can find a vaccine that works for this mandate. Speak to Israel.
5366,"Didn’t vaccines, prior to these current ones, use to work?"
5367,"As a South African, I know what&#39;s gonna happen to that money. Sad!!!"
5368,Vaccine mandates ??? Crazy !!!
5369,Yep that &#39;containment&#39; boat that everyone was hoping for...<br>has sailed.

5376,I dont agree.  Ppl have a choice. Test if ppl are immune
5377,72 percent vaccination not enough? What are they afraid of if vaccination really works?
5378,"Number of contagious means nothing. Deaths and uci patients are important BUT must be counted considering ONLY those getting to hospital or dead due only for covid, NOT any positive. If i get an accident and i&#39;m positive, i go to the ospital or die because of the accident and Not for covid!?! That&#39;s how they are counting in Italy🤦‍♂️🤦‍♀️.... It all smells sooooo fishy"
5379,"Shameful, don&#39;t comply with this travesty!"
5380,EU democracy at its best 😂😂
5381,Are vaccinations failed to defeat covid-19 epidemic expansion especially among vaccinated individuals...for that its converted to politics matter 😉
5382,I agree with spain.  Stop all the b$.

5394,"S. Africa Vac rate is 4 times lower than Spain, visit Our World in Data, S. Africa is doing well better than the Spanish Gov."
5395,Maybe Austria should vote out that parliament. Who was that historical figure from Austria in the 1930s and 1940s that caused a few million deaths?
5396,"The sad part about the logic with Spain is that they basically are using the hospital system as a buffer. Good or bad, let the hospitals deal with the Fallout, we&#39;ll see how long that lasts before their healthcare workers quit"

5423,"So once there is a mandatory policy the pandemic will be over in Austria right? And the virus eradicated? I assume Austria will be 100% virus free with zero infections and transmission?

5441,"How are kids holding up to the lockdown. No need for children not to have continued playing out, seeing their friends and having a normal life, but adults pushed their paranoia onto the kids. A total crime by adults, if you ask me!"
5442,"I spend plenty of time with my kid. We read, I teach her things about engineering and joke around. If your worried about child health then spend time with them."
5443,So even though toddler aged children have a very low risk of being infected day care centers are still requiring regular testing. What a waste of testing. Testing when it makes minimal to no changes in what is done is wasteful.
5444,"I really don&#39;t get why &quot;high schools&quot; don&#39;t adopt a more &quot;Asian&quot; type of approach to who changes rooms between different classes!<br>Thereyou often see that, class has a &quot;stable&quot; room, and it&#39;s the teachers who changes classroom in between classes! So that the hallway aren&#39;t full every new lesson, but it&#39;s only the teacher who are in the halls at that time, to walk to their next class(room). Same for breaks, let them have breaks in their (class) room (I know it&#39;s less social than a dinning hall or whatever, but different times call for different measures!)<br>I thought of this the first month of Covid, how has something of this nature not  been implemented jet, it seems such an easy fix for that 🧐😇"

If you care about your child, teach him by yourself. You have internet! There are so many websites, program, books, library, channels foe kids. School is prison for your child. Do you remember your school? How much did you learn? Elon Musk had home education. Rich Dad Poor Dad had learn how to earn money NOT in school!"

5477,None of the other politicians on either side of politics resigned over flouting lockdown rules. So good luck getting rid of this one. I doubt this would make anyone want him gone that didn&#39;t want him gone beforehand.
5478,"All over the UK, any people who actually have social lives are looking at their phones from a party, reading this news, and going &quot;shame on that man, he should know better.&quot;"
5479,Taking down Boris Johnson for his partying is like Al Capone getting jailed for tax evasions.
5480,Would the apology be enough? Hope that we ordinary people can also go away with it. He has to go.
5481,All this outrage over a garden party makes the UK a laughing stock to the rest of the world.
5482,"Brexit and COVID… please let him stay for the end of the world, he is quite fit for the task."
5483,"&quot;Leave politics, Boris&quot; cries out the Commons Chorus."
5484,"Yeah, i&#39;ve always suspected that hair. The signs where in our faces all the time!! Just look at him🤣😂🤣Boris hair is like that because he party too much"
5485,All talks no action. I wonder where does the saying &quot;Action speaks louder than words.&quot; comes from.
5486,The question should be why this hasn’t happened before. Sadly I suspect the same reasons will apply now - and nothing will happen (again). The UK is stuffed.
5487,Boris Johnson had the worst hair day ever 🤣
5488,He made papa Trump proud.
5489,Turns out it was a blessing in disguise <br>Happy we not in uk <br>At least on the 24th of March corona will end in the UK even if you test positive you don’t have to isolate
5490,Where&#39;s this &quot;Lawmaker&quot; tag come from? It&#39;s not in the British political lexicon.
5491,Lawmakers should not be a lawbreakers
5492,boris johnson is hilarious
5493,Cut him some slack! Boris hair is partying every night all night without him even noticing!
5494,"Can the UK keep leadership for more than a minute? Maybe it is because I am an American, but it seems dysfunctional to constantly have the legislature remove the executive (I know they are kind of one in the same with parliaments, but you get my point.)"
5495,No body’s perfect
5496,The chorus says &quot;go Boris&quot;.
5497,🤣 &#39;party-gate&#39;
5498,"All well and good , but we all want to know when the liar is going"
5499,Germany <br>God help you
5500,Just a work meeting tho.
5501,Boris having parties while my mother died alone.
5502,Partygate 😂
5503,"Character In the video It&#39;s great, I like it a lot $$"
5504,Pappa 🐷 is going down⬇️ I always thought what a cool👍 Hairstyle 💇‍♂️ but that’s about it.
5505,Well I don&#39;t know about him but I don&#39;t have any confidence in his hair stylist
5506,Looks like Trump but parties like Clinton
5507,Peppa still believes in Bojo! 🇬🇧 🐷
5508,This dude has the most stylish hairstyle I&#39;ve seen in a politician.
5509,The past 12 years Conservatives were in charge of government not one Prime Minister lasted the course.  BoJo’s political capital has expired.
5510,a clown has no shame...
5511,&quot;For the first time in history the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who refuse to take it.&quot;
5512,民主真好，干的不好就下台，等我的对手下台后再回来！<br>然后我的对手也在等我下台时！
5513,Like trying to remove a difficult stain
5514,"This pathetic excuse for a PM has stripped British politics of all decency honour and basic moral values, and not just British politics as such horrible examples spread into the world, if Britain can why can&#39;t I, dictatorial regimes may soon mushroom, sad👎✌"
5515,Downfall
5516,Bye bye Boris
5517,"what a shameless PM, as the leader of a country during a crisis he should be a shiny example, he should step down rather than trying to stay as the PMship has already been tainted by his actions..."
5518,Teflon Trump... Silicone Rubber Boris
5519,So it´s&quot;partygate&quot;? Nothing else to expect from Fantasy-Island than comedy i guess since you britons have long left sencirety and reason behind and treat it as a vice instead.<br>Long live the porridge!
5520,0)
5521,DB BORIS
5522,we SUPPORT BORIS FU.......NG Covid and dancing with friends!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Bravo Boris!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5523,"Sorry, Boris has made the scape goat...all frustration is hurled at him, as if public service is like searing a sofa.<br>What is the harm in having a couple of drinks after work.<br>Just the fact that someone took a breather with his staff after a series of whole days work...<br>I&#39;m sorry....the barrel is pointed at wrong direction."
5524,"Oh God ,he had a party 🎉 it&#39;s trival people, meanwhile, back on TONGA...."
5525,first
5526,Vroom Vroom
5527,British people are jealous of Boris for having a party? 🤣
5528,Boris is r8
5529,How about they talk about Chinese spy in labor party. Of course they gonna press this nonsense issue of party. He is a prime minister they have large staff and have to meet people.
5530,He should not resign
5531,"Seriously, are we saying China’s zero-covid policy is &#39;endangering global supply chains&#39;?. I have more supply chain concerns on the receiving end of such exports. For example,  America. The USA does not have enough terminal operators. They don’t have enough truck drivers. And they don’t have enough workers in the logistics sector. Rather than saying China is the bottleneck on the global supply chain, China has remained the powerhouse driving global trade and supplying vital PPEs and other goods non-stop to the rest of the world."
5532,"DW, the CCP should give you a medal for doing these types of &quot;news&quot; and &quot;journalism&quot;, because you are practically turning your audience into CCP fans through constantly insulting everyone&#39;s IQ and trying to make China look bad by focusing on the ONE THING that they are actually doing quite right.<br>And your efforts to shift blames from the government and large corporations are just adorable."
5533,"With 2021 in retrospect, we can use some trade and inflation data in assessing China’s covid policy.<br><br>Besides being the only major country with positive GDP in 2020, China’s 2021 GDP jumped to 8.1%, the highest in the last 10 years. For the same period, its export surged almost 30% to the highest level of USD3.3 trillion. As the export figure represents the value of shipped merchandise, any claim of supply chain disruption within China is automatically dispelled. Such exports include general goods (like clothing, electronics) and personal protection equipment (PPEs) like facial masks, eye shields, gloves, full-body suits, etc. On top of that, China has also shipped a large number of respirators and covid vaccines - which are vital and life-saving for many countries in handling the pandemic.<br><br>China’s inflation rate in 2021 was very muted at 0.9% (estimated), reflecting the fact that China has managed its inflation under control despite the world in QE hyperdrive. On the other hand, USA’s inflation was 4.7% (estimated) for the same period. Perhaps the more alarming thing is how USA’s CPI is trending. Its Dec21 CPI was a staggering 7% (compared to China’s 1.5%), the highest in 3 decades. America’s runaway inflationary pressure has its domestic roots of QE, supply chain disruption, labor shortage, and massive covid relief subsidies - none of which is related to China.<br><br>These 2 countries are in stark contrast. For America, the situation is pretty dire - high inflation, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, the Great Resignation, the Great Sick-out, empty supermarket shelves, the unrelenting pandemic, the great divide (vaccines vs no vaccines, mask-wearing vs no masks), the bipartisan government as well as the imminent rates hiking. On the other hand, we don’t see any of these problems plaguing China. Its ‘dynamic zero-tolerance policy has proven to be successful in the past 2 years, notwithstanding the advent of new variants.  Hence China is well-positioned to face off all emerging risks and provide a much-needed buffer to the global supply chains problems seen elsewhere. What do you think?"
5534,"Where were you appreciating China&#39;s zero COVID poilcy when it was working miraculously for the last two years, keeping the shelves full in the stores all across the West, while the Western govts were debating whether to even keep the said stores open??? <br><br>The anti-China bias at DW, and Western media at large, is so frustrating at this point!"
5535,"They are among the few countries still delivering the goods we need, are they."
5536,"That is one perspective. Your view is that by China doing everything possible to prevent the virus getting a foothold in the country they are endangering the supply chains. But is it not possible that IF china used the same policies as other countries the death count would be so much higher, and then in fact the thread to the supply chain would be so much greater. Is that possible?"
5537,"it is rather interesting to invite a teenage taiwanese to comment on China economy! well done, DW."
5538,"If China don&#39;t have such policy, their workers will get sick and manufacturers temporarily shut down. <br>You don&#39;t have the goods either?"
5539,"If the world adopted zero COVID policy, life would be normal by now."
5540,Now the western countries have some time to unload and load all the containerships. US probably will have work enough for the next 2-3 months.
5541,"DW without fail shows how to stay at the bottom cesspools of journalism, well done!"
5542,bruh you got supply chain still running in the past 2 years because of china&#39;s zero covid policy
5543,The bottleneck is at the US ports. Chinese ports are fully automated and least affected by the pandemic.
5544,"2021, China export increased for over 20%............please report the situation base on real life."
5545,The greed of big companies who tries to maximize profit at any cost made this situation
5546,The world followed China in it&#39;s initial lockdowns at the beginning of the pandemic but countries one by one jumped ship and let the virus circulate . There maybe attempts to slow spread as not to overwhelm the healthcare systems but there are not many zero policy countries left . You could say China is the most protected from this virus or any other that may pop up  but we don&#39;t know yet is that a good thing or bad .
5547,China recorded biggest trade surplus this year. So it is obvious that the supply chain in china was not disrupted. In fact the supply chain in other countries are disrupted due to the so called co-existence policy. That&#39;s why they surplus is so big.
5548,"Edelman 2022 survey shows that Chinese people trust their own government and is the highest 83% in this survey, while US only got 43%.  What does it mean?"
5549,"DW news on China, often brought to you either by an Indian reporter, or some guest from Taiwan, or quoting some ‘independent’ NGOs producing ‘alleged’ report on China’s dark secrets. If I want news of the type ‘someone heard someone else said they heard something’, I’d definitely choose DW."
5550,&quot;For the first time in history the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who refuse to take it.&quot;
5551,"Move supply chain to Vietnam during 0 covid strategy there<br>Vietnam abandoned 0 covid strategy<br>Move supply chain back to China, again.<br>DW conclution: 0 covid strategy sucks.<br>Btw that&#39;s the same strategy Taiwan use but DW call Taiwan success yet a danger move if used by China. How double standard"
5552,"Actually it&#39;s the opposite. That&#39;s, zero-covid policy greatly help the world economy supply chain.<br><br> If the zero-covid policy is hurting the China&#39;s economy, then why did the China&#39;s 2021 export reached the highest level in a decade?"
5553,"America would be a miss if they didn’t start to build our own factories back and get the raw materials to build back our economy,,,, Butt Washington is to busy arguing over issues that need to have settled with Bipartisanship so our Country can grow and move forward!<br>Let’s have unity and work together 🇺🇸"
5554,"Don&#39;t ignore that China&#39;s single digital growth (8.1%) last year is still much higher than major western countries. China&#39;s export also hit a record high in 2021. Therefore, the westerners should  take care of their own business and worried about their own problems. We  are doing just fine. I&#39;m sorry if that disappoints you."
5555,This was started from US being blocking of imports to the Port of Los Angeles. It strained thousands of cargo ships in the harbor not allowing them to unload until the sailors were isolated for 14 days.<br>Now you blamed on China&#39;s zero Covid policy.
5556,Can you imagine wishing other people getting sick to improve your economy?
5557,"Topic is about mainland Chinese policies, interviews a Taiwanese. DW could have been far better if they interview people that are on the ground."
5558,This is what happens when you don&#39;t diversify.
5559,"not the place where you want an update on economy. whoever thought this is a great topic clearly doesn&#39;t know where the bottleneck is at the moment. you already got plenty of package sitting at the door waiting to be opened but you&#39;re screaming at Amazon for not shipping more orders asap.... oh lord. these guys probably doesn&#39;t know any of that, they&#39;re just reading a script written by some interns."
5560,Who would have thought moving most of world&#39;s manufacturing to just 1 country could potentially be a bad idea. Why not even the profit-hungry corporations thought of diversifying their supply chains is beyond me.
5561,Well us got its wish on reducing trade surplus. The only thing is it will leave allot of empty shelves
5562,China&#39;s highly effective policy for dealing with the pandemic meant their economy returned to normal in the late spring of 2020. So it&#39;s having a very positive effect on supply lines. China&#39;s policy also helped to save a huge number of lives.
5563,"So they need to keep doing their businesses knowing how easy an infected worker contaminating the products with covid and without even a care in the world about other people&#39;s safety?<br>With people refusing to be vaccinated or wearing a mask, who don&#39;t care about the safety of children, elderly or humanity. All we care is me and me or me?"
5564,"So why the West worried about global supply chains? Don&#39;t you want to de-couple with China? China has no problem with internal circulation with their gigantic domestic economy of 1.4 billion people. You suffer, so be it. You asked for it."
5565,"It is time we started manufacturing and development at home again, instead of buying made in china. Let them shut down the market for their own products, we need to invest in local. When this is finally over and China wants to start shipping get again, let it be to late. Build back at home, no matter where you are."
5566,"It is so funny, always like to interview some guys who are biased against China.  It&#39;s rare to interview the Chinese journalists."
5567,"The way you put up with your questions also comes with some sense of bias,"
5568,Most ridiculous report of 2022 so far. <br>“China has a problem”<br>“Let me talk to some random bloke in Taipei rather than someone in on mainland China”
5569,"How ironic, dw want see other peoples dying.. where is human right meh?"
5570,Its about china so why you asking someone from Taiwan? its like asking a North Korean scientist about south Korea
5571,Tbh  if you look back 6 months ago the ports was already  backed up
5572,"Achtung! German historian Angela Schottenhammer warns that a slight hiccup in China could disrupt the whole global supply chain. She draws examples from the annals of China&#39;s ancient trade with Europe and Africa and Arabia from 700AD to 1200AD, all meticulously recorded in her book called Maritime Emporium of the World."
5573,"i am so sick of hearing what china is doing etc. well, germany and usa are the top most countries benefit from china. damn."
5574,Yes and thats a good thing. We should free ourselves and get all the critical production back!
5575,OF COURSE you bring someone in from Taiwan to talk about the doom and gloom about the Chinese economy :)
5576,"Halirious. The lockdowns are in small parts of the country or small districts in a city. These measures ensure that other parts of china function normally, which make sure that the supply chain is not disrupted too badly. Without the zero covid policy the virus runs rampage and that is when the supply chain will be disrupted. And we care about human life more than the profit of your big cooperations. Sorry but not sorry."
5577,China， running soo fast.<br>USA and its minions：we were actually competing for the slowest runner to be the winner🤡🤡🤡
5578,solve your port backup before mentioning China
5579,不搞下China，Russia，DW没法过日子。。
5580,It’s impossible. <br>Note: Impossible unscientific and illogical.
5581,They complain about slave labour but are worried about supply chain due to lockdown.
5582,low quality news and DW’s weekly dose of xenophobia
5583,Price to pay for putting your eggs in one basket.
5584,Didn’t Trump say we need to stop depending entirely on them for goods and products. Was he right? Maybe so.
5585,we need to build our own manufacturers with machines that make anything we need and completly cut China out and supply ourselves and compete with them to supply it everywhere else.
5586,Manufacture at home as much as possible. Stop depending so much in one single country.
5587,Don&#39;t Europe and the United States care about human rights?  Why is capital more important than the right to life now?  How Europe and the United States do not care about human rights in the face of capital
5588,Should the world not think now of the risks involved in becoming so dependent on China?
5589,Name one more effective covid policy so far? I&#39;ll wait
5590,Is 800k death in the US endangering supply chains?
5591,Just opportunities for other countries.
5592,"Better yet this is the time for America to manufacture.. Buy raw resources as the only main import, then initially subsidize small businesses/manufactures to ensure American made products are profitable again."
5593,"Short answer, yes. Why yes it does"
5594,"Well done China.  Remarkable  increase in GDP of 8.1% for 2021 it says all.<br>All the best to the Chinese people doing just what needs to be done to grow , improve and make all happy."
5595,"its a flex on their part, nothing to do with COVID. and thats what you get for sending all your supply chains to one country!!"
5596,This is the consequence of out sourcing
5597,"They got to know, they can&#39;t hide from this"
5598,More reason to build &amp; supply it all in the states like it used to be
5599,Where have all the other countries gone?
5600,Which variant are they worried about? Let&#39;s not assume it is Omicron. Maybe it&#39;s the new one mutated in rodents and escaped the lab.
5601,The phrasing is kind of weird. Isn’t this a sign that the world needs to diversify its suppliers instead?
5602,And this is why global supply chains are an awful idea. Make things locally. All the save the planet people tell lies that meat is bad but ar fine with trucking junk all over the world.
5603,"OK, you are starting to talk NONSENSE! It’s because of zero covid that they were able to keep up with factories producing and supply the products to its consumers. It’s not just a finish product, they supply materials and half finished products as well. If they don’t control it then that would be a bigger problem, it would have caused so much delays. My bf posted a package to Australia by fedex, supposed to be delivered within 5 days but after 2 weeks still hasn’t been delivered, why? He called and found out that down at the fedex center in Australia half of the staffs are sick with covid."
5604,Long supply chains are a risky problem for every country and business.<br>The PPE shortages should be a lesson for everyone. Manufacturing of critical goods needs to be done locally.<br>Countries need to provide jobs and goods with local manufacturing. It is time for many companies to bring back manufacturing to their home countries.
5605,just decouple from China and done
5606,When China grows too fast DW does a couple dozen scary China stories. When China grows too slow DW does a couple dozen scary China videos. Groundhog day reporting
5607,Amen
5608,The Lord works in mysterious ways......Amen.
5609,Zero policy? r u kidding?
5610,almost as if we shouldn&#39;t be reliant on cheap Chinese exports
5611,Come to see how well Chinese feed the whole anti-China business🤡🤡🤡
5612,A country that actually might put its people before $ is a good thing DW???????
5613,Didn’t Trump say we all need to stop totally depending on them. Was he right? Seems so.
5614,Why? Do they know something about the virus that most of us don&#39;t
5615,Is there an apology forthcoming ?
5616,Lives are more important than material goods and wealth right? Or is DW suggesting the opposite?
5617,And in 24 hrs their will be news in DW that Corespondent Tsung Han Tsou goes missing from Taipei&#39;s newsroom.
5618,Thanks you so much for you
5619,How dare they don&#39;t allow their people die for keeping our shipment speed!
5620,Enjoy omicron china Virginia 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
5621,How about the question: will A Covid break-out in China affect Global Trade? The Answer is 200%!<br>It is easy to pick an issue. The key is to provide solution or comparing to alternatives.
5622,Eh the US will just learn to deal without. This is a good thing as far as I&#39;m concerned as it will likely prompt more companies to remove there manufacturing from China.  This should excelerate that trend line by several years above averages as companies scramble for new suppliers. Once that happens its unlikely given the political environment in the US that these companies will look back towards China as a manufacturing hub.
5623,trời ơi :)
5624,That’s a very good thing now maybe 🤔 poor people all around the world can work
5625,Time to buy Vietnamese stonks🚀
5626,"It appears that a teenager in Taiwan is the authority of Chinese economy. ,🤣"
5627,The solution is more domestic production of goods. Being too reliant on one country for goods gives them great leverage. Things can be made in Europe and the US. Low cost goods can also be made in other economies such as India and other east Asian countries.
5628,Bring the jobs home!
5629,China has done its share on global productions in the past two years.
5630,"Interesting, the host should also ask what&#39;s the last time the &quot;reporter&quot; pay his visit to mianland."
5631,"It always is the animals that pay the ultimate price, due to human arrogance &amp; stupidity! 🤬"
5632,"Let be honest, hamster is not an animal that go outdoor much. It&#39;s more likely the COVID spread from human to hamster."
5633,This isn&#39;t the first time animals have been culled because of covid in other countries including European countries
5634,Justice for hamsters!
5635,I saw a clear “aspiration” before the vaccine injection!!! Bravo!!
5636,"Everybody talking about Germany, stay strong hamsters of Hong Kong"
5637,What would happen if dogs start to get infected? Would we euthanize all dogs that have been in close proximity to each other for the sake of decreasing the possibility of allowing a new variant to form?
5638,Good luck everybody with the Turky-vac.<br>I hope it works. The fact that there is no data can&#39;t be good though.
5639,Poor hamsters in Hong Kong. . .what a deplorable gov&#39;t they have.
5640,"The report should say 100,000 &#39;reported&#39; infections. Germany is barely doing any testing compared to the rest of Europe (212,000 average daily tests) so of course they are reporting fewer infections. For comparison France and the UK (similar population sizes) tested over 1.4million people each yesterday."
5641,"The tracing app in Hong Kong,  which is only absolutely required for government premises and restaurants, is not very useful because of the high usage of public transport. Who remembers exactly what time they took the bus or train? And no one knows the person they sat or stood next to."
5642,&quot;Hong Kong is culling hamsters&quot;<br><b>shows picture of a guinea pig</b>
5643,Is anyone concerned that if the hamsters passed the virus back to human that the variant could be even more deadly?
5644,He said that it&#39;s amazing that it&#39;s happening in China. HK is not China. That was weird. The reporter in the Hamster story clearly talked about Hong Kongers.
5645,“Turkey is one of the most innovative and progressive countries in the world” xD what a joke
5646,I bet millions of dogs all over the world have gotten covid too. Glad that a new variant from pets wasn&#39;t an issue as far as we know.
5647,All of a sudden theres a bunch of infections. Like we were living without all the worry now it&#39;s the focus of the decade. Smfh. What is really happening to the world that they don&#39;t want us to know
5648,"Don’t kiss your hamster people. <br>Also, do hide your hamster from the authorities."
5649,"How absurd is it that people who don&#39;t contribute a single penny to science, talk about vaccines prepared with a lot of effort !!!"
5650,"Is it a Turkish delight, and will it be delightful for the vaccinated"
5651,So sad when see high level number of infected covid19 people  lets try to use kariyat capsules (general name call as &quot;fah talai jone&quot;)  it will help to fight against covid(especially in my country it work) thank you
5652,"Why won`t they just admit, it can never be stopped?"
5653,"“Aight so don’t kiss the hamsters, kill the hamsters” is the quote of 2022."
5654,and when they come out of restrictions it will start again
5655,WHO gave emergency approval for that Turkey made Vaccine. Then what&#39;s reason for arguing ?
5656,While the government is partying in close doors like the British did
5657,I am impressed that they could hold all of those hamsters down while putting that long cotton swap up thier little noses.
5658,Here in the states it is probably over a million since Florida and other states just don&#39;t care any more.
5659,Legit upset about the hamsters
5660,Does it work only on Turkey?🦃
5661,"Infections , but how about death?"
5662,"&quot;Record infections in Germany that sound frightening. But is it?&quot;<br>Yes. Yes, it is."
5663,It&#39;s nightmare. Everything is going badly.
5664,I got wodkavac sometimes but after too many boosters can be also dangerous...
5665,Zero COVID policy. What a joke 🤣
5666,Don&#39;t worry. I give 4 to 5 week to Germany to sort out
5667,"If they made this Turkyvac using the same principle as Erdogan&#39;s cut-rates-reduce-inflation masterclass theory, we can continue shorting Turkey for sure."
5668,If a foreign hamster sends you a letter DON’T OPEN IT !👍 thanks China
5669,Well done Turkey
5670,Turkiye* not &quot;Turkey&quot; anymore
5671,Even today morning i saw people not wearing masks in Frankfurt in crowded markets. Germany needs to introspect big time.
5672,All the luck to the beautiful Turkish people 🌹💖💯🌟
5673,"so is the vacine really working if your highest rate of infection is higher, after 75 % of your population are fully vacinated? inono you tell me"
5674,😥😥<br>Allah vorosha! Our prayer for all beloved Deutschlanders .....
5675,Why do leaders keep saying the same thing?  It&#39;s not that bad? Yet?
5676,"Hello, I am speaking from Nepal. By profession, I am a health worker. When I want to live online in Nepal from Nepal and use my GB to earn money, is it possible? Please let me know if there is any web site."
5677,Is it based on the Chinese vax Sinopharm (like Hayat-Vax of the UAE)?
5678,God bless 🙏🙏 and stay strong Germany💕
5679,Turkovac... Sinovac... Sputnik one... Do we see a nationalist trend here?<br>I hope Turkovac is made for Delta and Omicron otherwise it&#39;s pretty much useless.
5680,they should vax those hamsters first.
5681,😔

5685,Lots more people and animals will endure illness and death because of this covid pandemic.  Nowhere close to an end.
5686,How about deaths?
5687,Were the hamster wearing wooden shoes?
5688,"Don&#39;t kiss the hamsters, kill the hamsters. Damn well made me spit tea out my nose. Maybe the animals got covid from a worker, that has been happening since this started 2 years ago."
5689,😂😂😂😂😂😂
5690,"Omicron will the end of Covid, RIP"
5691,We’re now killing hamsters because of Covid?<br>Have we LOST our minds?
5692,"It looks like the vaccine passports and wearing masks outdoors in France didn&#39;t make a blind bit of difference. It&#39;s only symbolic anyway, Governments know that, rightly or wrongly, they are held responsible. So if you see people wearing masks everywhere it&#39;s a daily reminder that the government is trying to help, while letting the unvaccinated get the blame."
5693,Thanks you so much for you

5716,can we eat the hamsters
5717,Good.
5718,SOMETHING IS WRONG
5719,Why don’t you report this with a semi-positive spin. Add that it’s the equivalent of that many fully vaccinated people. In 1 day
5720,Goal is to make everyone equally poor
5721,Oh no why
5722,How many deads?
5723,"not only hamster, also mail or even email can pass the virus to you lol"
5724,Exactly how many infections have the vaccine stopped (omicron)?<br>Likewise what it&#39;s the reproductive rate?<br>Now if you don&#39;t know the answer to those questions...<br>Ya might be somewhat a disadvantage here.<br><br><br>The answer to both questions should shock you...<br>Youtube is sensoring on this topic...so I can&#39;t give you the answers...

5728,Powerful rich culturally beautiful turkey 🌹💖💯🌟🌎
5729,How do restrictions against unvaccinated help when most people who get OMICRON are all VACCINATED?
5730,"For the life of me, I can&#39;t understand why Germany&#39;s PCR capacity is so low. The commentator in this video says that the (PCR) testing capacity of Germany is 1.5 million per week, which means ~2.6 tests per day per 1,000 people. When the UK was in the same situation (a few weeks ago) they did ~9 PCR tests per day per 1,000 people, i.e. ~3.5-times more than Germany. Israel has been doing recently ~21.7 PCR tests per day per 1,000 people, meaning ~8.3-times more than Germany. Why is Germany being so inefficient/incapable when it comes to coronavirus PCRs?"
5731,"South Afrika gives much needed hope to the continent &amp; wider world.Glad to see people enjoying themselves and having a good time..Stay safe,together we&#39;ll beat this thing."
5732,This is such good news overall and I am so hopeful that we are coming to the end of this pandemic. It would just be lovely to see everyone enjoying themselves without the worry of catching or passing on a deadly virus. Stay safe everyone as you are all wonderful 👏 ❤
5733,"In the 4-th wave (with Omicron), South Africa recorded 4,000 deaths out of 630,000 cases, which means a mortality rate of 0.6%<br>In the 3-rd wave (with Delta), South Africa recorded 35,000 deaths out of 1,350,000 cases, which means a mortality rate of 2.6%<br>Thus, the mortality rate (so far) during Omicron wave was only 25% compared to Delta wave (75% lower)"
5734,"Its wonderful to see people smiling , it brings tears to my eyes , I hope people see  that this covid pandemic has no boundaries on mankind we must remain vigilant still, we have been given second chance to preventing the next pandemic from happening again around the world , love peace to everyone ✊"
5735,"Omicron might be &#39;less lethal&#39; by the numbers but in the case of SA, it&#39;s largely due to the fact that so many people already got COVID before... Who knows how bad it would have been if omicron was what the world saw in early 2020 considering how contagious omicron it is.<br><br>It&#39;s maybe it&#39;s more apt to say that humans are better equipped to fighting it after two long years."
5736,"Welcome news for South Africa. We are having a significantly different experience with Omicron in Canada, where deaths and hospitalizations are greatly exceeding the numbers from Delta and Alpha variant waves. We are also experiencing higher Omicron fatalities (per capita) than any other western country. We have high vaccination and low natural immunity compared to most countries. We might simply have more vulnerable people due to our relatively easy time with Covid to date, or we might be witnessing a demonstration of the relative importance of naturally-acquired immunity versus vaccination. Here&#39;s hoping the wave will pass as quickly for us as it did for South Africa."
5737,"So far I have not contracted this virus. It&#39;s likely due to a combination of getting the initial two doses of the vaccine, receiving maintenance IVIG dosing and being on hydroxychloroquine (for Sjogrens, an autoimmune disorder) along with making a concentrated 95% effort of being a hermit and isolating from society."
5738,wow DW giving optimistic news about COVID quite incredible
5739,BIG THANKS FOR SOUTH AFRICA . REST OF THE WORLD FOLLOWS !!!
5740,"can we safely assume those undetected and unreported case are even milder?  especially in developed countries, means people don&#39;t bother to get tested or don&#39;t have symptoms at all"
5741,I see a ray of hope for the world just by watching this video…
5742,Deaths usually get noticed even in a 3rd world community.  Great work Africa and all done with little vaccinations
5743,Amazing how DW covered the views and facts that natural immunity has been discovered to be effective at protecting against Covid.
5744,start reporting on covid deaths in south africa as an example of how natural immunity goes in comparison to the vaccinated and boosted countries..
5745,I guess that nobody estimated simple difference between demographics and complicated difference between health care quality in Africa vs. Europe.
5746,less deaths because hospitals and staff know what they&#39;re dealing with<br><br>less severe symptoms because previous infections and vaccines usually prroduce a non self destructive response<br><br>and more people are taking basic immune health seriously with 3-3 raw fruits a day.
5747,"Believe it when I see it.  At least three times the virus has been declared &quot;in retreat&quot; and it was an &quot;endgame&quot;.  Yet here we are going on 3 years in.  So far, the optimism only lasts until the next variant pounds us."
5748,it will be a hard time if there will suddenly come a new varient 😢
5749,"If SA has high rate of natural immunity (many were infected) with just over 96 000 out of 60 million people dying, the disease was fatal for 0.16 per cent of the population (closer to 0,3 for Americans). So on all counts we have done well, with most deaths happening just as vaccines were rolled out. All round the country has fared better than most first world countries (as has the rest of Africa). The perspectives on the reasons for have to be much broader and I doubt vaccines have been even quite significant in any outcomes, if at all. A tiny percentage of the population were vaccinated during Delta, with increased vaccinations during Delta (too late to be effective) and then a drop off of vaccinations, only to pick up agin during Omicron (to late to have any effect)."
5750,"“… better things that you can do, rather than complaining…” is the first understatement of 2022."
5751,"Thank you to south Africa , creating a natural vaccine accessible and available to entire world."
5752,Yes I can vouch for not underestimating omicron. I have it right now and it&#39;s no cold. Much worse.  I can&#39;t imagine how bad it would be if I were not fully vaccinated.
5753,"The virologist is wearing a cloth mask while his nurse is wearing a medical mask. So, no one is making a big deal about the masks there unlike in the US with the recent hysteria. Additionally, no one in South Africa seems to be fixated on QR-codes and/or vaccination passports unlike Europe with its hysteria and policing. Thanks to South Africa for sharing useful information in due and timely manner."
5754,"...well done, South Africa.....well done :-)"
5755,Declaring a disease endemic is more simply declaring that we&#39;re giving up on trying to actively contain the disease not that the threat is necessarily gone.
5756,South Africa looks so beautiful! I want to visit!
5757,Is it just me or are they a little disappointed we&#39;re doing okay?
5758,"Omicron came from the cape of good hope ,and I am not very superstitious but I would happily be this time"
5759,One question how is every news outlet talking about endemic state if there is no reassurance of a new variant hitting us again!!
5760,"Rethink, Omicron is a hard way to train up our immune system."
5761,"here&#39;s a difference the news NEVER tells you. In SA you have to wear a cloth mask when out and about but also you sanitise your hands in EVERY store/office/establishment that you enter. Having lived between SA and Germany last year this has been the key difference. Here in Berlin, sanitising is not a thing which doesn&#39;t help with the spread of any virus or germs."
5762,&quot;For the first time in history the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who refuse to take it.&quot;
5763,So what would be the point of a vaccination if you need to get regular infected with the virus <br>That beach looks amazing <br>The sunshine in South African looks so nice from winter in European
5764,Omicron would finish but looks like new challenges awaits humanity like natural disasters aliens etc.
5765,Hope it goes well for SA. New Zealand celebrated early in mid 2020 for being Covid free and went into long lockdowns after that.
5766,Scientific reason lacks in many ways though
5767,This will be the first pandemic endemic virus. Congratulations 🎉
5768,"ultimately, in a way, there&#39;s really no other choices since there&#39;s so many human cultural factors (close down businesses etc);  the weaker/immunocomprised will have to pay the price of the freedom and privileges of the successfully adoptated majority~<br><br>it is far from possible now to &#39;save everybody&#39;.. actually this has been this way since about 2 yrs ago~"
5769,So sad when see high level number of infected covid19 people  lets try to use kariyat capsules (general name call as &quot;fah talai jone&quot;)  it will help to fight against covid(especially in my country it work) thank you
5770,"Nich information, in my opinion, the country must increased the number of vaccine to its citizen to control their pandemic wave"
5771,"WE are vaccinated and its less brutal, pre vaccines i lost 4 extended family members"
5772,"The Omicron variant of the virus is not necessarily more infectious biologically.  If anything the virus is likely less infectious biologically.   That is why symptoms are much milder and it&#39;s flying under the radar,  thus allowing it to be transmitted to other people more easily. With respect the the human host, it can be said to be less infectious.  i.e. less virulent and less invasive biologically towards the host.  However the flip side of that means host to host transmission opportunities increase,  as more people with relatively mild symptoms,  interact with other people in the community.  This results in greater transmissibility over the population.  However the virus itself per se,  is not necessarily more infectious, even though the community spread profile,  creates the impression of greater infectivity."
5773,"Where is the last tick of the latest Case came from? I just checked until 17th, continuing going down.<br><br>You cannot learn from South Africa as only 26.6% of the population Vaxed. Natural immunity is the king and some community report says lasts over a year."
5774,Wow!
5775,good news sad thatr our gov will ignore it and keep  us in fear mode 😭
5776,"You realuze both charts: cases&amp; deaths are going up-the ones you displayed.  Why spread possible disinformation?  I saw people smoking in a public venue indoors.  2021 480,000 tobacco related deaths USA.  100K OPIODS AND 95K fro. Alcohol.   Also I can&quot;t find annual covid deaths 2021.  We can all hope for the best but should be prepared for the worst."
5777,News outlets finally catching on?
5778,"I no longer care what the silly scientist, or the LOL, experts, have to say about anything."
5779,"When you &quot;keep immunity up with regular infections by coronavirus&quot;, what were you protecting against, again?"
5780,"A weak variant doesn’t mean a weakening pandemic. The goal of viral epistasis is for a virus to constantly mutate and look for new way to infect people and subvert natural immunity. With so many people around the world getting infected, we are still giving the virus ample trials to mutate into something deadly again. And in our global times, all it takes is an infection of a new variant in one country to eventually spread to all the others. I’m not super optimistic, but cautious about the news in SA. Hopefully this means we’re closer to endemic status, but really that’s based on a combination of getting as many people vaccinated and dumb luck."
5781,Good news!
5782,People dying from Omicron or with Omicron? Is SA the only country where people are dying of Omicron as presented here? I think not!
5783,"I hope basic immune of individuals every where rises up ( through  healthy nutritional,  vaccines decisive &amp; finally solve of this epidemic"
5784,"Wow, this is a beautiful place."
5785,"Triple the infections, a third of the deaths. Journos respons: &quot;Many cases go undetected. Do not underestimate.&quot; <br><br>Bill Hicks once did a bit on advertising and marketing. Journalist are the new markerteers and advertising agents."
5786,"At last,truth about natural antibodies, correct .Thanks Prof ."
5787,Thanks to the party 🥳 boy Boris the pandemic ends. He is gonna lose his beautiful PM&#39;s salary because even his own people are willing to kick him out of his cushy political job. And the only thing that can save him if he opens UK up. I think he is the main driver of this endemic beginning.
5788,Shout to all these fabulous upbeat  people. Life could be really good again.
5789,Yes Finally It&#39;s Endemic o End The Pandemic of COVID 19 And Return to Being A Normalcy Live Again This Year 2022
5790,Omicron was on the news only but us ordinary citizens it normal as usual
5791,"lets get to normal, its already been two years and lets focus on other diseases whos care is not found yet.."
5792,South Africa has now become the canary in the covid mine.
5793,the OmiCold panic is much worse than the disease itself
5794,"This just gives me more DEJAVU when we thought we were done when the Delta variant was more prominent, I wont be surprised if a new variant arises in the next upcoming months....brace yourselves lads"
5795,"Meanwhile another variant has developed, but the media isnt reporting anything new about it since it was first announced.."
5796,Why does DW delete comments asking about if natural immunity is more effective in the long run against the virus than the v@#&amp;Ines? Scared of questions DW? Or would that be your pharmacutical companies that don&#39;t want those questions asked?
5797,"Had Omicron just before Xmas, it was as bad as a mild cold....."
5798,"D W, <br>you platform of information <br>In honest way,  it,s harming  the peoples <br>with the astronomical information, the image on your video to create the social impacts out of context,"
5799,Lol we didn&#39;t even stay locked down through it. We just lived and enjoyed our holidays. It was a good summer. Hello from cape Town
5800,finnaly u come with terms with omicron DW after 1 month of fear spreading
5801,"I&#39;m just worried that the increased case amounts means more chances for the virus to mutate into something worse, omicron seems to be lulling people into a sense of security thinking that since it&#39;s getting milder that means the end is near, I hope for this too I&#39;m just worried what might happen"
5802,Don&#39;t say too loud we&#39;re coming to the end of the pandemic.<br>Next variant could be deadlier than Delta
5803,Wish I can SA for winter break
5804,BUT WAIT! There’s more!
5805,Praise the Lord! Been praying 24/7 and nothing hard.  Lord is Good &amp; I say join me Israel.   Cheers Mary with God&#39;s team 2022
5806,Safe &amp; <b>EFFECTIVE</b>  ....😂
5807,It is milder. Period
5808,Haha 😃 the pharmacy get so piss now they can&#39;t get more money 💸💰
5809,"To me, all this &quot;happiness&quot; just can create another variant..."
5810,endemic
5811,Looking at the graph going up again doesn&#39;t look good
5812,"There are three islands in Antarctica named Delta, Omicron, and Coronation. The &quot; next &quot; variant will be named &quot; coronation &quot;. That&#39;s when we see the zombies ......."
5813,I can breathe now
5814,LMAO 🤣
5815,next variant is going to be a killer
5816,"Wow, DW let it out that prior infection can provide protection. Are you sure your big pharma corporate warlords approved this script?"
5817,"DW try hard to fearmonger, but sadly for them, the facts can no longer be dismissed 😊"
5818,Sheet that woman has a deeper voice than me bro!
5819,Never learn it&#39;s lesson.
5820,Dont forget South Africa is in summer now. So it willl take a while for us at the North
5821,"COVID-19, we have now integrated in their society, bonus mutation points"
5822,Where did the South Africans who acquired immunity through previous exposures get their original immunity from?
5823,"Come on DW, let’s milk those COVID clicks!!!"
5824,Funny how the 3rd world saved the 1st world
5825,Enough is enough. We have the vaccine. Let the people work and live.
5826,“Israeli study shows 4th vaccine shot ‘not good enough’ against Omicron”-1/17/22
5827,This is not the end
5828,“Israeli finance minister tests positive for coronavirus”. He tested positive 5 days after getting his 4th booster shot 🤔
5829,"Cases may go underreported, so the real number of deaths could be higher? How does that make any sense. That would simply mean that people aren&#39;t going to the hospital. Simply put, the virus is less lethal. The mental gymnastics needed to reach the opposite conclusion is mind baffling."
5830,Finally
5831,Millions of people are walking through Germany throughout the week and they come up with this.
5832,“Life is ten percent what happens to you and ninety percent how you respond to it.”
5833,"Honestly I live in Prague. But in germany it’s totally crazy. Vaccine QR code checked upon entry into a shop. I was denied entry because I had a face mask, not a respirator. At the train station refused to sold a sandwich for that very same reason. Beyond ridiculous"
5834,&quot;A lie told often enough becomes the truth.&quot; - Vladimir Lenin
5835,"Good for them, shame on the police though for the uncharacteristic harsh treatment."
5836,"“The illusion of freedom will continue as long as it&#39;s profitable to continue the illusion. At the point where the illusion becomes too expensive to maintain, they will just take down the scenery, they will pull back the curtains, they will move the tables and chairs out of the way and you will see the brick wall at the back of the theater.”- Frank Zappa"
5837,&quot;For the first time in history the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who refuse to take it.&quot;
5838,thumbs up for the people who haven&#39;t made their way to the hospital after being jabbed. Nobody saying a word about them
5839,I was in Berlin three weeks ago with a group of other students and we went to Museum Island where there was a huge anti mask protest with lots of police everywhere. We happened to be going to the Amplemann store and stayed while the protest group passed. Then went on with the rest of the group to Brewdog.  Get the pineapple punch.
5840,fight for you rights germany!!! support from malta and serbia
5841,"As long it was peaceful, this is good.  People will always disagree with science, sadly, but I applaud the civility."
5842,That was risky.
5843,Keep walking Germany!
5844,"Lmao German here. Those are not medical students. They are regular people who wear a doctors robe. That’s why the police sent them home. Because it’s illegal to dress up as a doctor, if you ain’t one. ✌🏽"
5845,Looks like they got some of their own medicine 🤣
5846,"Professor Ehud Qimron, head of the department of microbiology and immunology at Tel Aviv University - “Two years late, you finally realize that a respiratory virus cannot be defeated and that any such attempt is doomed to fail. You do not admit it, because you have admitted almost no mistake in the last two years, but in retrospect, it is clear that you have failed miserably in almost all of your actions, and even the media is already having a hard time covering your shame.”"
5847,Medical students who aren’t qualified in any field of medicine or yrs of experience

5859,good for them.
5860,why cant people just bloody stay at home ?
5861,This made me relate to people like flat-earthers. It&#39;s kind sad these days that politics has infiltrated certain field of science and to some extent social responsibility.
5862,"Walk means walk. So, clearly they&#39;re &#39;not&#39; walking if they&#39;re standing in large numbers outside a hospital. Book &#39;em."

5875,"There&#39;s a BIG difference between being against vaccine mandates and being against vaccines. People that protest against mandates are often vaccinated, they just don&#39;t want the gov&#39;t to mandate their healthcare and their freedom."

5909,"Awesome! And get a good look at their faces! So you can say remember me, when they get to ICU!"
5910,Prostitution is a crime Dr
5911,"I am fully vaccinated, will get my omicron-specific booster and advocate everyone to get their shots too. but I&#39;m 100% against mandating a vaccine that is 1 year old."
5912,"Beyond the Covid, you will need their services in the future and i hope they deny you them"
5913,"Sure, ask the just out of school medical student. She knows her job. I finished my studies in December, and I can tell you, I would stand opposite her."
5914,where it&#39;s student come from?
5915,"Because of the economic crisis and the rate of unemployment, now is the best time to invest and make money."
5916,"thank you, <br>Respect  to all the protesters, <br>👍👍👍"
5917,How do these students know those protesting the mandates/restrictions aren&#39;t vaccinated just because you protest the mandates doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re anti Vax.
5918,Take the time to think about the difference between someone who is pro-vaccine but anti vaccine mandate.

5925,Good on those students for standing up against bioterrorists.
5926,Get vaccinated to keep medical&amp; pharma business boom. If you want live in this world you must pay to the riches.
5927,Hmmm 🧐
5928,Freedom of Choice.
5929,"Poor students getting screamed at.  Sadly, the same students will be greeted by the antivaxxers when they are full of tears dying in the ICU."
5930,"TBH, Anti Vaxxers should pay for their own medical bills, when they get hospitalized for Covid and not wastes tax payers’ money. A solution to potentially end this pandemic, through vaccinations and they still refuse. Instead of protesting against getting vaccinated, do they have a better solution to end this pandemic?"
5931,Great! Can&#39;t wait to get the next few variants because of the rise in cases...
5932,"More than what will be required. Infection vs death rate doesn&#39;t seem to matter to these folks but it should matter when it comes to hospitalization! So many people in the US nonsymptomatic. Found to be infected when admitted to the hospital for unrealated causes and tested as a byproduct. My  daughter and granddaughters had diagnosed cases of COVID-19 and recovered. What medical reason is there for them to risk side affects including death for no medically proven advantage by taking the vaccine? What reason, what cause. I&#39;m just the triple jabbed grandpa trying to figure out what is best for my daughter and granddaughters. What advice can I give based on numbers and percentages to assist in helping them make up their minds?"
5933,A wonderful journal coverage of this seriously issue by DW news....good health for all every where
5934,Luckily the evolved into a less lethal variant this time. In case it regresses into the original SARS strain the carnvial of insanity´ll perish like flies. So let´s hope for the best shall we?
5935,"I’m a nurse at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio and due to staffing shortages the national guard is there filling the positions that they can i.e. medics, housekeeping, dietary 🤷🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️"
5936,wow I&#39;d never thought I would ever hear in my life a kid being afraid of not going to school. When I was a kid I hated so much going there.
5937,And here in Kenya the numbers are dropping. U wonder coz the numbers were high in December coz for one to travel  they had to test themselves. No the number of people traveling has dropped.    So the numbers have dropped
5938,"Calgary, Alberta, Canada Omicron Peaked last week and will be over in 2 weeks. Testing done by City workers at The City Sewage Treatment plants."
5939,Expert say  it’s unclear how deadly the virus really is in part because a large number of cases mild  or asymptotic infection . May never been diagnosed.  What will happen in near future?  Continue mutate another virus  or Are we continue inoculate into poison in our body?
5940,"Just wondering how 90,000 cases in the last 24 hrs??? Maybe 90,000 people had their tests in the last 24 hrs!! Amazing 👏 work, keep it up!"
5941,"Though its spreading like fire, luckily, its nowhere as dangerous as it."
5942,It&#39;s increasing by double everyday in almost every country
5943,There’s no doubt there will be more and more variants after omicron
5944,Schools had plenty of time to install double flu heat exchangers and heppa filters but didn&#39;t.
5945,Cases in the UK have fallen sharply by 50%. How is it a surge?
5946,Looks like India is starting to try to catch up on testing people
5947,Saliva test must be used instead of the other method.
5948,DW news does a  wonderful job.
5949,Some are saying it&#39;s more contagious than measles.

5951,<b><i>Here in Philippines 80% of people I know are infected by Omicron... vaccinated and unvaccinated. Good thing is the recovery is as fast as 3 days only. Omicron is indeed milder than Delta.</i></b>
5952,Consumers needs to have a stable gear/protected from lapses. Facemask to protect from allergic rhinitis and cancers from inhalation of bacteria/microrganisms.
5953,The  benefits of this virus could be that all the kids will value education and in person contacts when the pandemic ends.
5954,I LOVE these vaccines🤪‼️💉💉💉💉💉💉💉‼️🏴‍☠️🥳
5955,"Ahh, what a blessing to be in a poor country! <br>Omicron = fewer deaths than delta. All socialites I know got Omicron too and did not die! <br>So courage. It is over in a few weeks!"
5956,Thanks for the info
5957,I don&#39;t think doing any sort of restriction is gonna help especially when omicron is as infectious as like a normal flu.<br>Restrictions today will not do anything other than creating economic hurdles<br><br>It will end when it has to end. And with omicron it seems to be going into that direction
5958,Testing is the legit way to get a day off from work. Lol
5959,So we don&#39;t wave the patents but ship the doses that are expired to the poor countries and call it donations? Shame on the patent greed
5960,New variants fly into the UK the move east across Europe
5961,It&#39;s so exciting!
5962,"All we heard is that the number of cases will not be relevant anymore, because the idea was to not fill the hospitals and not have many deaths. And what do we hear? Only the number of cases. What a mess..."
5963,Omicron is just a &#39;tune up&#39;.  What I&#39;m concerned about is the next variant.
5964,Dis ist great news<br>thanks you
5965,can someone please explain why vaccination (that we know doesn&#39;t give long term protection) is the &#39;way out&#39; of this pandemic?
5966,&quot;A lie told often enough becomes the truth.&quot; - Vladimir Lenin
5967,"Omicron is easy. No ventilators needed anymore, just fluids and pain management"
5968,"What the government needs now is your continued obedience and more single use plastics, 2 more weeks probably and they will fix the health care system."

5970,Best government and the best system!
5971,DW: Me and all my friends and MOST of my family have 2 vaccine doses AND a booster and we all go covid!! Now what? I&#39;m over this😒
5972,"3 Characteristics of the new coronavirus<br>1. The looser the epidemic prevention, the faster the virus mutates, and the more serious the epidemic will be (a vicious circle)<br>2. The natural drying speed of saliva or droplets in the indoor environment in winter slows down, and the infection time becomes longer, which means stronger infection.<br>3. The lower the indoor temperature, the greater the rise of the droplets at 37°C, and the longer the floating time of the droplets, which means the stronger the infectivity."
5973,Hope the new vaccines do their job against Omicron....

5977,mandatory mask requirements would be more helpful against the spread
5978,Stay safe India 🇮🇳 we love you! 🙏🏿 Love from NYC
5979,"&#39;No clear difference compared to other countries&#39; - yet the official deaths and infections are far lower in Germany compared to the rest of similar European Countries (as has been the case in every wave so far). Unfortunately there has been a significant lack of reporting in Germany, the &#39;actual&#39; figures will be far higher but alas we will never know the true cost of Covid."
5980,The more cases the more variants
5981,Indonesia with 273 million people has only less than 1000 cases a day. Please learn from them.
5982,Real figure not coming out in a country. As private test kits are sold more.
5983,The vaccine gave me the sudden urge to buy apple/Amazon products 😂
5984,Bring it on!!! Have no fear!!
5985,I’ll pass on the booster that doesn’t work with omicron.  I’m waiting for the 1.1 vaccine in March and will continue wearing my kn95 till then
5986,"If the pandemic and hospital staffing is so bad, why haven&#39;t the world&#39;s military medical units been activated!"
5987,Well how about deaths?
5988,I thought it was peaking? They should stop reporting the cases like other countries are doing so the cases would drop.
5989,Nah! We&#39;re Cool here in South Africa.  👍
5990,UK... we&#39;re being told the rate is flattering out..  99000+ cases and 305 death&#39;s  and now we&#39;re being told all is good the peak has been  reached. So... 209  average beaths per day is ok? What?  How long will that rate last?
5991,"People are saying even if you&#39;ve had your 3rd or 4th jab you still can get the Omicron dan get sick, so maybe another few jabs would really protect you? Another 5, 10 shots?"
5992,"US and Europe should help the 3rd world (e.g., Ghana, India, Somalia, etc.) during this new wave!"
5993,Yea get vaccinated yea! <br>— Ok hopefully my comment won’t get taken down this time  😁
5994,"It will only last for a week or two and infections subsides as happenned in South Africa, the UK and Malta."
5995,"New VARIANTS lining up. IHU, Cyprus and new one in Israel."
5996,We normally have 800k a day common cold infections(ONS figures) and of course there are plenty of very old or very ill people who have to be admitted to hospital due to the effects even a mild viral infection has on them.<br>This isn&#39;t new..?
5997,"☝️☝️ we thanks you so much for the $4,000 PayPal transfer done for my family we appreciate you sir"
5998,Next mutation Xicron will be like  Omicron + Delta
5999,It&#39;s worse now than ever but people are working in person and going shopping etc. Last night I saw a bar that was absolutely packed. Masks optional. We dead.
6000,"☝️☝️. we thanks you so much for the $4,000 PayPal transfer done for my family we appreciate you sir"
6001,"Germany was  always  omnicron, thjey gave it to South Africa!"
6002,We have more vacineted pepople since the begining of covid and also the most infected. But still vacination is the only sollution?
6003,Meh. Is COVID-19 still an issue?
6004,LUDO LIU 2  . Meanwhile  in Lagos Nigeria 20 million people go about their daily lives with no mask/ no vaccine/ no social distance and all healthy ????? Figure that and  its  not the  only place  on Earth free of fear mongering
6005,News channels are so sad that omicron is way milder than they initially hyped . So sad that it did not create a big sensation. I feel sorry for the news channels.
6006,More🚫 contagious 🚫but🚫milder
6007,"After 2 years, governments and people already know what measures can curb the pandemic. New cases in countries, mostly in Asia, are a tenth of cases in Europe. You can blame governments, but ultimately it is the people, or that segment of the population that continuously impede  the efforts to control the pandemic, that are to blame. After all  you always get the government you deserve."
6008,"Been sick in bed for two weeks with Omicron - 30, healthy and vaccinated but not boosted. Certainly not an easy ride, as it has impacted both my work and health. I would heavily recommend getting boosted."
6009,"Quote ‘Tobias Kurth’ No I don’t see any difference between (the numbers of reported infections) between us and other Countries! What? More uneconomical with the truth. Three weeks ago Spain with over 200,000 daily cases, France with over 350,000 daily cases, yes, here in the UK with near 200,000 cases daily, but Germany reports daily averages, over the last couple of weeks, of less than 40,000 … try testing your population and then provide accurate figures. This is not a competition, it’s simply telling your population the truth, something your previous government had serious difficulty in presenting. Why did the reporter not pick Mr Kurth up on his false statement!"
6010,"Think long term for a second people. Here in Canada they rolled out 3 jabs and I hear Justin T. has ordered enough jabs to get to 2024 so if that&#39;s every 6 months (4 to 6 more jabs) ( and the current jab is apperantly only good for 3 months against Omicron) you could be looking at 8 to 12 more jabs. I don&#39;t like the lack of study&#39;s for long term effects with the 40 to 50 years I hopefully have left. I do think the jab is a very important tool for the ones with underlying health conditions but, doesn&#39;t really effect the outcome in healthy people. Man-dates did not work here in Canada as we seen un-vaccinated people have been banned from international travel for the last 3 months and the Delta and Omicron got into every corner of the country (remember the un vaccinated people were banned from travel during this time.) The &quot;safe and effective&quot; narrative the government pushes is not an accurate statement. So are you okay with 4 more jabs? how about 8? still good why not do 12 then. I want the Canadian government to release the data they work with and the natural immunity verses vaccine data they have and aren&#39;t showing. From what I understand the immunity from jabs is robust to start but, fizzel quickly(3 months it begins to fade I think). With natural immunity it starts off lower but is more robust down the line for a much longer duration info that is not provided by the Canadian government. It seems like this is all about forcing people to have a vaccine passport more than anything."
6011,STOP THE LIES NOW.
6012,Ow nooo! Omicron colds all over the place .. LOCK IT ALL DOWN! 😂😂
6013,"GOOD! I hope Omicron infections continue to surge, so that people can get PROPER natural immunity from it, which will bring this pandemic to an end."
6014,&quot;A little bit milder...&quot; ??? Data I&#39;ve seen says many times milder. I don&#39;tt trust what some people say.

6021,anyone sick and tired of covid news?
6022,"No pass,no test ,no mandatory vaccines!!!! Freedom!!!!"
6023,Germany can expect 300&#39;000 cases per day. There’s nothing against Omicron and it’s less dangerous
6024,Fear driving LIARS!!!!
6025,"China gets omicron outbreaks in their cities: <br>DW: OMG CHINA CAN&#39;T GET THE VIRUS UNDER CONTROL!

6026,This is good news! Get that herd immunity ASAP
6027,Dis is surging
6028,"If infections are hitting record levels, why do you think masks and social distancing have made any difference?"
6029,The government should distribute hydroxyqualoroquine and ivermectin to the public
6030,"More, cases, more 💰🎶😎"
6031,"India &quot;rode&quot; the previous waves? No, it drowned. The whole world saw India&#39;s desperate need for oxygen, people dying in the streets, hospitals overwhelmed, burial fires, bodies being dumped in the rivers... so many comments &quot;from India&quot; talk about how India handled the previous waves &quot;well.&quot; Did you all see the same news stories I did? It was chaos? India did not handle the previous waves well. I&#39;m not saying the rest of the world handled Delta well either. They just didn&#39;t have the bodies burning or bodies in the rivers. The rest of the world just had cremations going quietly and refrigerated trucks for the overflow of dead bodies."
6032,When newspapers are saying planet..became a (small village)...that means all  kinds of phenomena including epidemics like  omicron wave are expanding swiftly every where... I hope omicron wave aren&#39;t causing too much illnesses in India and all other countries...
6033,The concern is the potential of a new variant come to existence just like the last time
6034,A democracy like India is prepared for everything!
6035,"Though cases may surge to half a million a day, around 70% of hospital beds are empty and enough oxygen is available."
6036,"DW missing the elephant in the room - Indian Assembly Elections in most of North India coinciding with the 3 rd  wave 🌊<br><br>Due to this policy makers are hesitating to put lockdowns and preventing mass gatherings rather it will encourage mass gatherings and political rallies . The politicians are against lockdown as it hampers the vote banks and funding from local businesses, which encourages the public to be more lenient towards following COVID protocols ,which would in turn cause a longer and taller 3rd wave over whelming the hospitals .<br><br>The establishment would then be forced on having a even harder lock downs soon after the elections and rallies  are over , so the government in power would enjoy the freedom and political sympathy they get get during lockdowns and govt sponsored healthcare and handouts they give to the people and in turn get a better political gain<br><br>In a large democracy like India <br><br>Where class system rules over the mass system <br><br>Politics always plays a larger role , much above the human lives and civil liberties"
6037,"Omicron is a fast spreader, even one is saying it&#39;s mild and taking it easy, if it mutates to another hasher strain  the hospital system will collapse, better start restricting measures or be sorry later."
6038,&quot;For the first time in history the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who refuse to take it.&quot;
6039,"india have manage the delta wave very well better than western country, I am sure they will manage well this time.<br>Edit: India was one of the rare countries to do early treatment BTW"
6040,The big affect for a country is loss of the workforce falling ill . This can occur for 10 weeks or more . Many disruptions to products and services but this should pass fairly quickly . It maybe better just pull the bandaid off fast and get it over with . Systems have showed they are resilient from past waves. Most will have a quiet summer but another surge will come in the fall . We shall see how the media will look at the virus at the time and if the virus will not be classified as a pandemic
6041,"I thought deaths and hospital capacity were the focus but with Omicron, journalist have bcome disappointed and now focus on infection rate."
6042,"India used Ivermectin last time which brought the numbers down drastically and quickly, and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll do the same this time! 🤷‍♀️"
6043,What about germ+any
6044,He just keeps deflecting direct questions. You know the answer.
6045,I hope DW pay more attention in Europe. European condition is much more severe than India.

6058,Our health infra is in terrible shape...its like we are on our own...
6059,DW should focus on Germany first. India&#39;s population is 4 times of USA and even density is much higher. If US is reoorting 1m cases per day 1-2m cases per day is okay in India.

6106,"There&#39;s hardly any mention of an important statistic about India in Western media - Only 3% of the population pays taxes - But of course, 100% of the population wants/needs access to infrastructure.  Despite these overwhelming odds facing India&#39;s govt and planners, many public systems such as transport and hospitals and universities continue to function, not optimally but admirably under immense pressure.  <br><br>Many developed Western countries couldn&#39;t cope with even half or quarter of the demand (not in absolute numbers, but even per-capita) that India faces on a daily, non-stop basis.  India has done well to vaccinate a billion people, enforce safety guidelines within a democratic framework, all the while avoiding economic collapse or mayhem.  Europe or the U.S. haven&#39;t done as well in comparison, with far more money and resources, and only a fraction of India&#39;s population (and population density) to contend with.<br><br>India&#39;s next door neighbour China, on the other hand, has much to answer for.  They very likely created and leaked this virus from the Wuhan lab, a guilt that the W.H.O. and other vested interests are too eager to push under the carpet."
6107,"From india, I am not vaccinated and never caught delta or maybe I did without symptoms.<br><br>I contracted omicron a few days back, it stayed for an entire day and that was it. All symptoms gone by the end of the second day."
6108,Really
6109,"No they did not prepare yet, i am from india, again same situation will repeat"
6110,"The concern for most indian today is how to guarantee the unbroken supply of cow p, as we know that indian vaccine require at least 15% cow p in its ingredients"

6112,"Our PM is busy buying new toys while we have neglected health care .<br>Please help us or else we will die soon , this wave will end my people."
6113,"Since India managed to glide through delta, then omicron will be a breeze."
6114,I will delete dw app henceforth
6115,"Over 2,600 people are dying daily in the US (CK covid stats US), BETWEEN 800K &amp; A Million plus daily infections here.  Stop calling omicron leß of a threat.  The numbers do not support this, nor does our understanding of viral virulence &amp; mutations.  I hope India &amp; Germany both understand omicrion will not end the pandemic. The Economist believes worldwide deaths are between 15 &amp; 17 million."
6116,Short Answer. No.

6125,"For all the comments saying DW should focus on Germany or Europe... fyi DW News covers WORLD NEWS. If you&#39;re embarrassed of your country not handling the pandemic well (news flash, most countries are handling the pandemic terribly) or would rather pretend everything is fine then don&#39;t watch world news."
6126,Unlimited covid19 Jesus Christ is coming repent is not too late at the end of the world
6127,DW report is much truth if Indian WION  report is only 200 cases.
6128,covid covid covid covid covid. enough about covid.
6129,Don&#39;t worry covid-19 won&#39;t survive ind** pollution 😂😂😂😂😂
6130,She looks awfully tired... Did she have to wake up in te middle of e night? Or is she exhausted from long working hours?
6131,The purpose of a &#39;Zero Covid strategy&#39; was never to meaningfully have 0 infection. It is to minimize the infection and to treat each detected case as a quarantine situation.
6132,"It is ridiculous that the news host making it seem like the western countries has actively made a choice between zero-covid policy and co-existence policy. The fact is that they had no choice but take the co-existence path. China on the other hand can still have both options open, it will watch what happens in the western countries and then make a choice."
6133,I am glad that the person whom they interviewed in China is pretty balanced.
6134,It is normal for the news guy to ask difficult questions to the guest. This isn&#39;t a talk show to get people excited about a product. Being able to respond to these questions shows strength. Being willing to ask these questions shows openness
6135,"A zero covid policy, if the entire world would have adopted in the very beginning then maybe we would not see so many variants. The problem is every country has their own rules, probably depending on the Constitution of their public good and interest, thus implementation of a single policy was not feasible. Hope, this be the last variant....."
6136,"People always forget that no measures are perfect.  Even the concept of a two week quarantine only covers 95% of incubation periods and remember most cases have mild to no symptoms even back with the original strains and the quarantines do not consider cohort groups where the disease can pass from one individual to the next.  The UK study that stated there was no active virus after eight days in their sample grouo did not fit a probability curve to their data so there is no guarantee that the disease woukd akways be no longer infectious after eight days yet we have our ten day self isolation policies now reduced to five days on tge basis of the mean incubation time dropping from 5.6 days (circa Jan 2020 data) to two days with Omicron, again no probability curve fit to determine the 95% confidence level.  All of our policies are on old, inconsistent, incomplete and questionable data, it&#39;s hard to believe a policy of absolute isolation can actually work with such procedures.  Tests, even PCR tests are of at the moment and are subject to actually sampling enough of the virus to detect and of course there are only so many tests you can do per day.  Zero COVID is based upon being able to absolutely isolate entire districts and cities and that in itself can simply not be achieved.   A zero COVID policy can slow down the spread hopefully to the point where contact tracing and subsequent isolation of outbreaks are possible but so long as there is some part of the world without measures as harsh, it may not be possible to maintain zero COVID policies for long and it&#39;s questionable how complete contact tracing can be, did they even distribute enough modern smart phones to effectively use contact tracing apps?  Most people&#39;s smart phones are too antiquated to effectively use the apps."
6137,I don&#39;t agree with professor Cowling&#39;s last remark regarding the zero COVID policy: &quot;fewer and fewer obvious benefits as time goes on&quot;. The obvious benefit is keeping potentially more dangerous variants out of the country not to mention preventing mutations altogether. This is especially beneficial as time goes on. As for the costs: The COVID-crisis costs are high regardless of the approach taken.
6138,"The host tried so hard to get the local journalist to criticise China, but failed so miserably."
6139,The anchor was putting forth very difficult questions hoping the respondents would give a negative answer about China and its zero lockdown policy. I guess he must be very disappointed.
6140,"Life has gone on as normal - no masks, normal gatherings, parties, no vaccination passes - for the past 2 years. Global inflation would be multiples of current levels of China tried to &quot;live with covid&quot; as manufacturing supply chains get severely disrupted."
6141,"The fact that even DW, a normally anti-China channel had to admit majority of the population supports the zero tolerance policy means it is working and indeed most China is spared from any form restrictions other than a wearing masks and taking vaccines."
6142,"Have we heard of Chinese starve to death because of the lockdown? I don&#39;t think so. Of course there is discomfort with the lockdown. And remember there is bigger disasters with not-locking-down. At least the Chinese government is working diligently on this. Wouldn&#39;t be easier for the government to NOT adopt the zero covid policy,  like the US? I think the Chinese government is  working hard and taking its responsibility."
6143,Basically unbiased report. I personally thank the reporter for his work.
6144,In my family and my sister’s family no one ever got infected since virus being but when Omicron come here and by now seven of us are getting Omicron but just a little sick for the young and not in a coma for the old or who have diabetes.China handles virus best and better than my country.
6145,"Simple, very strict SOP, effective social distancing rule, no unnecessary gathering, cases will go down ! Please, learn from the best !"
6146,"DW, that’s one challenge China is able to cope where Germany and Murica have failed so miserably……"
6147,I just feel sorry for the poor chaps that were &quot;evacuated&quot; on emergency flights from Wuhan in early 2020 to sit-out the pandemic in places like the UK and US!
6148,"For a country such as China, what would allowing COVID spreading in a community and living with it look like. That will be millions of people at least living with some form of covid. A new variant will inevitably jump up there. I think the China measures are harsh yes, food delivery and shortages, but they need to get the vaccines up again. Hopefully better coverage than the one they get."
6149,The world has become a small place with modern transportation that the pandemic can be spread within day across boundaries. China is protecting its own population and helping the people fight against the highly transmissible Omicron variant. That is the responsibility and commitment of a government to its people. China will do everything to make sure their citizens are safe and sound.  It is up to all countries to protect themselves and whatever strategy to combat the pandemic.
6150,"China is not the only country that pursues zero covid strategy, so is New Zealand."
6151,"Here&#39;s a quote for you, Fighting covid is like holding your breath....."
6152,"So far, so good... but I think the tables will turn when the Omicron variant takes hold.  Once seeded it will spread through 1.4 billion people quite quickly (especially in large cities) unless they close borders and lockdown forever.  I wish them luck with that strategy."
6153,So is New Zealand. We are nearly down to getting zero cases  Only 14 cases reported  today
6154,"It&#39;s hard to fail when you only report wins, not losses"
6155,"Advice from Australia: When the time comes to let go of covid zero, exit more slowly than anyone would think necessary. Exit too quickly and it will feel like you’re living in consecutive but unacknowledged lockdowns."
6156,Feels weird knowing more info about the story covered (Twitter witnesses) and the news mentions just bits a few days AFTER it happened
6157,"Right in the beginning, he immediatly forgot to say &quot;statistically&quot;. Well i mean the rural regions dont seem to count in any way."
6158,I wish this commitment was done at the beginning of the outbreak. We wouldn&#39;t be here in this unending mess.
6159,I like seriously trying to say that China should just leave with COVID-19 when their strategies have saved  hundreds of thousands of lives
6160,It’s rare to see unbiased and neutral reports about China.
6161,Western Australia (WA) state in Australia is stil have zero COVID policy
6162,11 minutes for the daily message that could be delivered in two words.
6163,"<b>Probably</b> the only country? Yes there is always the possibility that some unknown country in, say, Africa is doing the same without letting the world know."
6164,Lockdown in China is short and limited. Other provinces continue to work.
6165,Applause for the journalist in Beijing!
6166,“I want freedom to be the present and future of life for all (all human rights) and life platform culture.”
6167,"China has done an amazing job, sure they got some issues and western media loves focusing on that but overall the results are impressive if you can appreciate the scale and size of China"
6168,"Efficiency and efficacy once again exemplified….. This virus can be contained, and China just showed you how…… The sad thing is that the US and EU can’t even be a copycat….."
6169,I watch all of Banarjee&#39;s China report.<br><br>He is so bad at reporting and propoganda that its entertaining.<br>Good job DW 🤣
6170,Its funny how hard the anchor is trying to elicit a negative comment on Chinese policies from the professor. He must be disappointed.
6171,"It&#39;s still only one percentage of the Chinese population. For 99%, daily life is like in 2019. This has made China now the biggest economy in the world.<br><br>China is twice bigger than Europe. They are not giving up very much with travel restrictions."
6172,Concern about​ new variant​ in India more this.
6173,Taiwan&#39;s zero COVID-19 policy is still going strong too. If the rest of the world had been on board in the beginning then COVID-19 would be a thing of the past.
6174,"At least they can get a test. Unlike in Australia, you cannot get a test and if you lucky, you have to pay upto $30 aud for a test."
6175,Easy when you don&#39;t report cases or deaths...
6176,"China has lower vaccine efficacy, lower acquired immunity from prior infections, lower vaccination rate among the elderly, weak health care system outside of big cities, so zero-covid policy as it can still last, in the dead of this winter, is still a sensible choice. Living in hong kong, i wish i could visit my family sooner, but I understand the current strict quarantine requirement that keeps me out can statistically better protect my grandparents who are too ill to get vaccinated."
6177,"Let’s play the DaVinci Code game, China could have invented a new variant of Covid and testing it in their own cities, if the control are successful, then in the near future there would a new variant showing in UK, CANADA, AUS and USA, or either one of the western nations."
6178,I don&#39;t know what kind of rocket science china is using in thier traveling policy as she allowed business visa and work visa to travel but why not students allowed?
6179,If they would have locked down travel in and out of their country this enthusiastically at  the very beginning we would be fine now.
6180,The pregnant lady that was refused entry to a hospital did have a certificate all be it 3 hours out of date
6181,"I believe you misunderstood sir, China is no longer going to admit they have covered"
6182,If COVID came from them and they are implementing a zero COVID policy…
6183,对啊，清零政策，无疫情区跟疫情前生活差不多，羡慕不啦
6184,"This brings back memories.  Back in 1987, I was on business in China for a month.  The scary thing that I witnessed was a truck that was given full rights to stop any other traffic that might be in its way.  The rear section of the truck was packed with criminals who were strapped with ropes to the side panels of the truck bed, each looking outward.   All criminals were bald due to their hair having been shaved off. This whole setting was of course to put them on public display, for humiliation purposes."
6185,It has worked in Western Australia
6186,Like having zero aids virus? Zero flu virus? Give me a break!!
6187,The host&#39;s anti-China bias is slipping through. They should fire him so he can apply for a job in wion.
6188,They know something about COVID that the world doesn&#39;t know.
6189,I have not seen my family for 3 years because Chinese borders are closed.  Miss them alot.
6190,"Is this what we want in Europe, Canada, Australia and the US?"
6191,"During the pandemic, public rights is placed above an individual freedom. Zero tolerance to the hazard is a must to get people discipline themselves into social responsibility. It might not the best approach and still far more effective than those lips servicers.<br><br>At least DW admitted that China approach is the only country which no other dare to try."
6192,China influx of tourist is the only things keeping the world economy going. Not until this restriction is lifted will the world prosperity be the same
6193,"??? This is utter BS. I know for a fact that there are cases of COVID in Zhejiang and Hubei Province, for a fact."
6194,Só cute when he couldn’t pronounce the word
6195,"Hello, thank you for your balanced report. However, I have to point out that Taiwan is not a country."
6196,"Jabs are not stopping the transmission or the spread, Omicron is milder than Flu so end restrictions and treat as Endemic, anything else means it is all about keeping the new controls.."
6197,"What&#39;s really not justice and students are stuck from March 2020 and no hope in coming future so it&#39;s mean students career are darken,Chinese only support business from they can earn more and no justice for ordinary people"
6198,Journalist in studio fails misérably to try to make the journalist in China to criticize the policy in China. The local journalist insists to say that life is normal for the majority of people in China.
6199,"It happened in Tokyo Japan last year during Tokyo Olympic as well. A 33 years old pregnant 7 months Japanese woman with Covid wanted to go hospital, but all hospitals in the region refused. End up she have to give birth the baby at home and the baby die. Similar case also happened in Chiba as well."
6200,I&#39;m gonna bet that Omicron beats the CCP Zero Covid policy.<br>Any takers?
6201,"Omicron challenges the world, India included."
6202,Let’s do a thought experiment - what will China be like if they don’t impose strict Covid rules? I’d look at India for that answer. Both countries share a lot of similarities
6203,"They don&#39;t need to rush to buy toilet paper, they don&#39;t need to unplug the ventilator of the elderly, because steadfast living is also an art"
6204,Они просто отключили его на своей территории
6205,They invented it. They can mend it.
6206,"Good luck to ALL of the world in having ZERO Covid &amp; Varients cases!!!!  Everybody, Pray, Pray, and Pray again. Also, Please get vaccines ( if you&#39;re able to) and MASK UP!!!  🙏❤🚀   STAY HEALTHY!!!"
6207,Awesome accent! Very Indian! Very German.
6208,"I heard so many people talking about boycott products made in china. it is your opportunity now!  As a chinese, I wish government stay with zero covid policy, we do not need to use chinese labors exchange with US FEDS printing money.  I wish all Asian countries work less and let US inflation as high as possible. teach them a lesson about printing money!!"
6209,"&quot;Cero covid-19 policie&quot;, let&#39;s save lives!!! Let&#39;s protect our family!!!!! We want to be Omicron free!!!!"
6210,"blockade? It&#39;s almost Chinese New Year, just increase testing"
6211,Does anyone care about the Olympics? As an athlete I would not go
6212,The lockdown of some cities allow people in most Chinese to have a normal life. That is the rational of China&#39;s strategy.
6213,"Just to clarify, there were not &quot;several&quot; heart cases with the patient dying.  There was only ONE and that caused millions with anger and the government will need to fix this problem immediately.  Let&#39;s provide accurate news."
6214,With a few hours of video games per week and no option to go outside... what are kids in China doing?
6215,Tbh ……. And even if they „fail“ we in the west failed already in the beginning and never got it under control as they did. <br><br>If China has to adapt and change its policy because omicron is just not controllable then they do it.  But they didn’t fail for many month and due to that they safe many life’s. <br><br>I don’t like the Chinese government as well and they fail on many aspects. But what we can say is that they managed this way better than we did in the west.
6216,That&#39;s good considering they ended up giving to the rest of the world last time.
6217,"For effing sake, DW! Why not speak about how they learnt the lesson from Xian and improved upon the situation? A good example soon after the bad one in Xian was in Shenzhen. You bring up one bad case while you forget all the 100s of bad cases in several other countries. The news anchor just seems to focusing on negative only and keeps feeding words into the mouths of the reporter on the ground and other interviewees. Come on! Grow up!"
6218,👍👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
6219,The question is: does current western countries success in fighting omicron?
6220,"Chinese new year is January 31, wondering how the CCP restrictions are"
6221,China to reopen 2050 😂😂😂
6222,"in capitalism majority suffer for minority, in socialism minority suffer for majority"
6223,"It is really an interesting strategy. That said, the question is if we humans can overcome pandemics with vaccines only without actual contagion? In the worst scenario, China may face endless fights with Covid 19 even when other countries are overcome it. Because China has to stop the zero Covid policy sometime, it may be the beginning of a new pandemic for more than one billion uninfected people.  I hope I am wrong."
6224,"Not possible, anywhere again, ever."
6225,"&quot;But, at what Cost&quot;."
6226,They have the worst policy while we have the best: we have the best number!
6227,The GDP figure already told the world which Covid policy is better !
6228,"Strictly blocked?Please, don&#39;t talk nonsense"
6229,"Omicron is airborne, you lose China"
6230,"While other countries may seem to be suffering now, will achieve herd immunity while china will suffer while maintaining Zero covid strategy"
6231,Rolf explained the situation in a &#39;neutral&#39; way. Thank you Rolf!
6232,"I had it and finished quarantine last Saturday. I am fully vaccinated. It’s my second time catching Covid. The first time was worse and I expect that the vaccine did the work. I had a headache for two days and a fever for a day, shivers for 3 days, muscle pain like the one you have when you have a flu, sore troat, back pain. It didn’t feel too bad. Unfortunately I am asthmatic and it made my asthma worse. It will last for a couple of weeks at least if it’s the same as the first time."
6233,I applaud the man (Rolf) being interviewed for providing that final answer in the way that he did.
6234,"I’m pretty sure that I got it several days ago. Had 2 vaccines. Felt like a cold with fever, and head felt weird for couple of days. By now feel like healed. Smell dissapeared for a second, now is restoring."
6235,"My entire family had delta variant last autumn, only 2-3 months ago. I suffered a lot. And now no one of us got omicron in this huge wave in Europe."
6236,"Dear DW, please invite Dr. Campbell again. He&#39;ll give much more up to date news."
6237,"80.000 new daily infections.  Could we please know how many people are quite ill, how many are in hospital because of Covid, ill, how many have mild symptoms and how many are asymptomatic. Thank you."
6238,"For anyone who closely follows the situation in the UK, the US and South Africa, this prediction is OLD news. Researchers were saying this weeks ago and it is a positive development. Yet it’s treatment here seems meant to sensationalize."
6239,"Funny. Many doctors were saying this about Omnicon over 5 weeks ago. Two years into the pandemic and the WHO is still over a month behind. Anyone in Europe probably already know plenty  of people who have had it, and who are vaccinated."
6240,Hopefully it will be the end of pandemic …
6241,I hope safety for all ...&amp; successful treatments for all
6242,"&quot;... Strategy to tackle the pandemic.&quot;<br><br>Alright, it is time to quit pretending you are doing anything to stop anything."
6243,I’ve just gotten over the Omni virus.  It’s not that serious !
6244,"Well, not sure why is he focusing on the posibility of developing a new variant that is fast in spreading and highly pathogenic, since that is not what we would expect from the nature of virus evolving behaviors."
6245,Omicron is not like the flu season. It&#39;s like a base of what is to come.
6246,Where can I get the information where they break the stats for vaccinated and unvaccinated infections and deaths?
6247,"On wednesday night they sent out a wave of virus ....it got me and my sister and other friends ...i felt my body was invaded by some electric itchy feeling so i got my eagle and my lion out....but when i wen to bed i woke up in the middle of the night with my body extremelly overheated next day i felt like dying but didnt give up kept pushing thru with my awareness and now im fine again..<br><br>Ladies and gentleman this is a phsycological war agains your mind....the mind controler are sending those waves just like they can send signals for your phone, wifi ,etc.<br>I think its time to chase those bandits behind the government and those in power and make em confess all their sins and atrosities against humanity<br>So we can give em proper punishment for their actions. Its so obviious"
6248,"As pointed out already the eventual &#39;fall-out&#39; of Omicron will affect the vast majority of Europeans and this fact has been a regular feature of UK tv YouTube experts, Dr John Campbell being one such notable presenter. It may be the wonders of modern communications have by-passed the WHO, why not, everything else seems to be doing so!"
6249,This is happening all over the World 🌎  not surprised...
6250,Good news. Im okay with whatever variant but not with digital surveillance and mandates
6251,Only half? In six to eight weeks? The Omicron wave will be well over by then.
6252,"Why are long-haul flights the most vulnerable to contracting covid-19?<br>1. The plane is a confined space, and the indoor environment contains water in virus saliva, which naturally evaporates slowly, resulting in stronger infectious power<br>2. The plane flies at high altitude for a long time, the temperature in the high altitude is particularly low, and the indoor environment contains water in the saliva of the virus, and the natural evaporation rate slows down, resulting in stronger infectivity<br>3. The principle of hot air rising, the droplets spit out in speech are 37 degrees c, and the high air temperature is particularly low, the higher the droplet rise, the stronger the infectious power<br>Therefore, the use of a constant temperature system in the aircraft to increase the indoor temperature can prevent the 37-degree c droplets from floating up and reduce the infectious power<br>Therefore, the use of a dehumidifier in the aircraft can quickly dry the saliva and droplets in the indoor environment and reduce the infectivity."
6253,Oh my 💔
6254,Saying half of the population is like saying all of the population or nearly all of the population.
6255,How many test did they do compared to last year?
6256,Just stop testing if you only have a sneeze or a sore trought.. it’s winter.. 🙏
6257,"There isn’t even one isolated sample of this &#39;phantom virus, so what are you talking about?"
6258,"Oh no I don’t want mild cold symptoms, give me another booster!"
6259,"Got the Delta last yr even tho I was vaxxed. Im still young but the symptoms were moderate, only the cough was severe since I have asthma. I highly recommend the vax esp for the elderly, those with comorbidities, immunocompromised and healthworkers. But no pressure, if they dont want it fine. They are the ones who will suffer in hospital and bills anyway. Just dont get it why the govt is too pushy. These are adults for F sake, let them decide for them and suffer the consequences if needed. Anyway, its already proven that whether vaxxed or not, you will still get the virus. Vaxxed can have the advantage tho esp if you are old or with existing diseases"
6260,What has the rapid spread got to do with the unvaccinated? The problem is the government using only vaccine to solve the pandemic. Since when has the infection been reducing since vaccination starts?
6261,I predict it will be around 70%
6262,Why is nobody talking about<br> Omicron&#39;s death rate?<br>Can anyone tell me what is the Omicron&#39; death rate?
6263,I find people who wear masks in the supermarkets are better mannered in general😎<br>Gaz UK
6264,May God Bless Omicron 😂
6265,Is there any valid scientific indication that vaccination helps at all?
6266,So is the Chancellor also saying the cold and flu are dangerous because they spread quickly when in high season? People I know with COVID (vaccinated and unvaccinated) said that the flu was much worse that COVID.
6267,I got Covid-19 in the beginning of the pandemic and I had mild symptoms and second time I got the omicron variant and I didn’t have any symptoms except runny nose! Natural immunity just worked
6268,"Okay, I just saw the video about China and zero case policy and here is a video about omicron wave in Europe. So the wave is spiking daily cases. If half of Europe get COVID omicron and hospitals overwhelmed. Then what? People aren&#39;t dying that&#39;s good. So this new policy isn&#39;t better than the zero policy in China. At least you Europeans get better vaccine"
6269,When we can afford all thr luxuries possible before paying for essential services. Let&#39;s all realize social services have been under attack for decades. Late capitalism and consumerism is eating our lunch.
6270,"I am indeed grateful to the Managing Director of the IMF Mrs. kristalina Georgieva,for the $150,000 Grant they gave to me and my family.May God continue to bless the IMF and World Bank,As they Empower Citizens of countries Affected by the Covid_19 pandemic,through their SME Loan and Grant Initiative"
6271,2022 starts with a bang!! Humanity reaping what it sowed
6272,Time to close schools and move university tests fully online.
6273,I hope hundred percent coverage
6274,"Please pass an indemnity law with Vaccination, then many people would get vaccinated."
6275,NO ONE IS DOSED against the new virant omicron!!! Doesn&#39;t matter if you have three or four jabs. It has NOTHING to do with people who are not dosed.
6276,Most people will get Omicron because there is literally NO BOOSTER available for it...if you are getting boosters they are alpha and delta...so it makes sense why it&#39;s ripping through the world...there is no specific protection for it.
6277,Best strategy in the world!
6278,Does anybody still listen to what WHO says???
6279,"already got, just recovering"
6280,I follow Dr peppers advice! Crack a cold one and chill.
6281,&quot;For the sake of His sorrowful Passion have mercy on us and on the whole world.&quot;
6282,"hello everyone, <br>can anyone tell me what will be next if all global population is vaccinated?<br>I&#39;m just curious what the big pharmaceutical companies have prepared for us ."
6283,So that travel ban imposed by the EU on Southern African countries has not worked!! Meanwhile it has caused financial harm on the tourism industry during the summer/ tourism season...
6284,&quot;A lie told often enough becomes the truth.&quot; - Vladimir Lenin
6285,"This news is very different than news in other countries, such as England, where we think it&#39;s all over now. Medical chiefs are saying that people should just get out there and get omicron as it&#39;s as good as a booster for the vaccinated, and a vaccine for the un-vaccinated. Who is actually right?"
6286,and you still biasing china.hahahahahahahahaha
6287,"Wath is successful vaccination? A large number or people vaccinated. Successful for me and for other millions that where vaccinated to regain freedom, means  imunyty that was promised at the beginning. So we are far from successful now. Applause Spain"
6288,Questions to all experts and scientests in the whole world&quot; what is the purpose of vaccines where the efficacy of vaccines why most of our people are now infcted by omicron even those who are already taking their boosters ? Is there any problem of our vaccinces
6289,I am unvaccinated and I got it!!! Tested positive I had syntoms fever max I had 38.7 and sore throat. I recovered from it only taking Panadol extra now I am back to normal
6290,it&#39;s not dangerous...let it run
6291,740 million europeans. Halve of them is a lot
6292,South Africa is chilling and wondering what all the fuss is about.
6293,"What, not saying its mild anymore! Can&#39;t use the wall street spin anymore because to many dying! Leaving bad taste in your mouth! Or are you feeling a little guilty finally! Hospitals still full here, 48 passed away! Stay safe, and please take it serious!"
6294,&quot;For the first time in history the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who refuse to take it&quot;.
6295,Pretty well protected. that sounds promising...
6296,Oh God. Where we go?
6297,Stay home and save lives completely
6298,"I like how all European countries are competing for the toughest one at implementing even stricter rules, just when the EMA itself has advised against regular boosters as they are thought to compromise the immune system. All it takes is a large group of wealthy and well informed individuals with no ties to the usual suspects and no vested interests, and class actions will pour down for years to come"
6299,Wow half of European will become pokomons. 🤣👍
6300,"DW should chill and stop creating drama, omicron infections are fast but nowhere near as strong as the previous mutations !!"
6301,In Afghanistan Thousand and hundreds of infants and children&#39;s are infected known sick someone couldn&#39;t explain  we need help
6302,So is this mean we should get ready to lose more loved ones?? Because the WHO doesn&#39;t know anything???
6303,OMacron varient is spreading in France.
6304,I think Optimus Prime should just show up at this time.

6307,"You guys are better than Bangladeshi doctors, respect for you, <br>Bangladeshi doctors don’t see patient without money, they are very very greedy and selfish, they don&#39;t even have proper medical degree."
6308,They do what they can.  Not even doctors can´t stop the spreading of this disease.   That ´s the way things are.
6309,good.. then we can get over this ridiculous head cold.. and get on with our lives.
6310,How many where vaxed?
6311,Good 👌
6312,If we vaccinate the whole world there will still be some mutations in breakthrough cases and animals
6313,So many vaccinations yet so many cases. Why.
6314,Why only half the populattion and not everyone ?
6315,This world are getting more and more crazy!
6316,"Don&#39;t worry about Omicron, IHU is coming to get ya!! 😷"
6317,"Countries with high levels of early vaccination plus boosters probably have lesser amounts of natural immunity in their populations. They would have had fewer infections and thus lesser amounts of natural immunity following all the vaccinations. It&#39;s natural immunity that protects against Omicron so such countries may be harder hit with a huge volume of cases. Australia, in particular, worries me in this regard. Of course they also talk funny. <br><br>Countries with lower levels of vaccination probably have greater amounts of embedded natural immunity and these might fare relatively better. South Africa might be a good example of this. I want to say India, too. However, the population of India is so huge that any numbers coming out of India must also be huge; even if proportionally less huge, this fact will be difficult to see behind all the media exaggeration. <br><br>Of course Omicron is not nearly as severe as prior variants but even so, Omicron is so transmissible that every country, regardless of (guesses as to) amounts of natural immunity, should be expecting and should be making preparations in expectation of issues relating to sudden very large volumes of Omicron cases."
6318,"Let&#39;s hope it&#39;s much more than half, so that this EXTREMELY MILD variant can SAFELY spread PROPER immunity and bring this pandemic to an end."
6319,"Half of the first class earthlings, the only ones that matter"

6322,so tragedy it is tsunami hot spot whole europe
6323,"I had omicron. It&#39;s very mild. You&#39;ll have a headache, a bit of a sore throat and feel tired. No problem."
6324,"only news channels care about Omicron, people don&#39;t about it anymore"
6325,"It isn&#39;t.  We are all in house every house in Germany ,  not in hospital."
6326,Why? The wax clearly doesn’t work!!
6327,"All I am saying is if I get 3 polio shots in 1 year and I still get polio, I&#39;d start asking questions."
6328,Wished that WHO stopped spreading this kind of nonsense. From all the people tested they can never tell if they have delta or any other variant. Then where are they getting this new alarm and panic news from that Omicron is spreading on such tempo ??
6329,I got it .( no jab on me ).very mild symptoms <br>my girlfriend who has 3 shots already got it and got very sick..<br>Actually she is still in bed right now
6330,How is Sweden doing?

6333,"So, not only does he disobeyed he&#39;s own rules as he is also a cheapskate... Bring you own Bottle? Come on Boris, can&#39;t you afford to offer the drinks?"
6334,There will be penalities for who break rules : Borris come to my home lets party 😂😂😂😂
6335,"Excellent vid.<br>If our Prime Minister doesn&#39;t resign today, UK will be a lost cause, totally"
6336,Boris has always  had different rules for himself and has no idea <br>what truth is
6337,"Lifelong Tory voter! Both my partner and I are now voting Liberal! Enough sleaze! This is turning int Nigerian politics! Before the rot sets in, get rid of the ‘merchant banker’! Else the whole party will be sacrificed for one person’s inability lead, and the rest of the party not having ba**s to stand up to him! My mum passed away 11 months ago, she wasn’t allowed visits till she died! My blood boils at this government!"

6344,BOJO is a walking talking meme 😆
6345,"It isn&#39;t that he defied COVID lockdowns. I personally never followed ANY COVID lockdowns ever, and I never will. The problem is that he imposed - nay, FORCED - these ridiculous and unfounded and unjust laws upon the people and even had those who refused to comply arrested, while he didn&#39;t follow his own crappy rules. That&#39;s the problem. I am proud of an average citizens who refuses to follow the lockdown rules."
6346,Johnson is so damaged now that he is a liability to his own party; he has to go whether he is innocent or not.
6347,Would they have done the same if it was a real pandemic?😉
6348,Government Ministers are Previlleged to Do So. Common People suffer like Duffer.

6351,"Boris Johnson&#39;s leaving party, everybody welcome BYOB."
6352,But He wont be removed because he is main person who supported brexit which made people suffer now 🤐

6354,"Why would the government send the email to 100 people, one of them would eventually spill it"
6355,They partied while the plebs got fined and harassed for not wearing masks.  It&#39;s not surprising at all.

6357,He&#39;s done.
6358,“ Great labels from MEDIA “
6359,It&#39;s obscene. But Western politicians are obscene.
6360,If truths be open. I bet even over here in America with the government leaders here they are doing the same thing..
6361,i remember when British media critizice italian managament of the pandemic.... XD
6362,"Cmon 😂 look at him, he is a clown, not a leader 😡 On the other hand, for God’s sake, our former president told people to drink bleach, organized political coup, people died!  He suffered no consequences whatsoever, ZERO! 🤯 Looks like yours is not that bad (in comparison 🧐)."
6363,"Im suprised that lots of India in the Torries. Btw, BoJo is the worst PM but with brexit starting to kick on, he should stay so he cant evade responsibility.<br><br>Btw, one thing i dont understand with this &quot;rule&quot;: you arent allowed to hold a party but at same time football stadiums were packed with spectators. So wheres the logic in this??"
6364,"So what if they sack him?<br>He feels he&#39;s got the job done just becoming Priminister. <br>Main goal acheived in life.<br>Now its down to the pub<br>Baby , the lads.<br>Oh yes the wife."
6365,"He&#39;s not the only one. Even the president, govt officials and military in May 2020. While we were all locked down."
6366,"Matt Hancock worked for the Bank of England as an economist, our current Health Secretary &quot;Sajid javids&quot; was Managing Director of a Deusche Bank, Boris Johnson was actually born in the USA and his family work within News, Media and politics... Our NHS is in the process of becoming privatised due to interest from wealthy business owners just like our Royal Mail during the reign of David Cameron, it&#39;s time for change or our children will face the consequences from our lack of action."
6367,meanwhile people were getting fined for doing the same 😂😂. I do have better things to do than humour corrupt politicians inner power struggles!
6368,Once a cheater always a cheater... there&#39;s no remedy to cure BJ lies.

6374,Have you seen the queue of Tory nutters waiting in line for the throne?
6375,There will be penalties??? Really?
6376,Sorry I can&#39;t talk about what I did as it&#39;s under investigation?? Will the investigation prove he wasn&#39;t implicated or just kick the question down the road while praying for public sentiment to cool?
6377,Pretty sure there&#39;s sth going on behind the scene and someone in tories want him gone<br>Otherwise why leak now instead of during the lock down<br>Interesting to see what happens next

6423,Omicron is smarter than all these corrupt tyrannical politicians😂🤣👍
6424,A shortage of tests seems to be something that every country is experiencing. I&#39;m surprised that this long into the pandemic and we are still seeing shortages.
6425,"If the booster inforces our immune response as stated, why are cass still skyrocketing?"
6426,We warned this earlier<br> ...And they called us &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39;
6427,Don&#39;t you love how the virus crosses boarders without a pass.
6428,"The contents of the boosters is the same as the original vaccines, mRNA is the same, only dosage differs. Therefore it&#39;s not about varients, the vaccines don&#39;t last."
6429,"In China since the start of pandemic coronavirus has a parallel incident in Africa that Omicron is over now. It may happens to other countries as well, as in the case of America that contracts Omicron and being considered as epicenter again."
6430,"I notice that they do not aspirate when giving injections. Also, if the vaccines are very efficient, why do they have to continually have boosters?<br>🤔"
6431,God people must be protected. Lord 🙏🏼 we ask for your Healing powers over your chosen people and for everyone who is fighting this Virus. Prayers for Israel. God bless us.. everyone!
6432,Vaccines are important.. but only focusing it so much.. makes the mutants much harder complicated strong after a period of time .. Immunsysteme is also bombared with hormones.. so many people were before Covid mentally sick &amp; depressed.. or stressed work .. we still have no solution for it except medication 😑same twist vaccines didn’t help for solution
6433,How come no one talks about all those who are now naturally immune because they were infected. This is fantastic news. Why doesn&#39;t anyone celebrate it?
6434,"No one question, Israel is highest rate vaccine population!!! We need to move to preventive methods."
6435,Nowadays we like to do same action but hoping for different outcome..
6436,"The very same is happening in Brazil right now: omicron cases are skyrocketing (aside with the Influenza A - H3N2, which is also quite infective, leading to many cases of &#39;flurona&#39;...)."
6437,I suggest we all get booster 3 4 5 6 7  8 9 and 10 at one time to be ahead of the virus. I think it will be a great idea.
6438,&quot; Underlying conditions&quot; is far too broad to be useful information. It can be anything from inconsequential mild asthma to being 90 with dementia. Even diabetes or &#39; overweight&quot; are not definable categories that are helpful. Mild type 2 diabetes vs insulin dependent diabetes. 20 lbs overweight vs morbid obesity..  &quot; underlying conditions&quot; could capture almost anyone over age 30 if defined broadly enough. Yet that&#39;s what we&#39;ve heard all along and we are left to define it by our own assumptions...
6439,A wave in the most vaccinated country in the world.<br>Shouldn&#39;t this be happening in lesser vaccinated countries?<br>For some reason they&#39;re going perfectly with their lives.
6440,So whats next... a mandatory 5th booster shot??<br>As a footnote Science do NOT SAY &quot;more boosters are better&quot; it could it could be but might not be.
6441,"If omicron cases are skyrocketing in a country where most of their citizens are vaccinated and have taken also booster, then what is the efficacy of the vaccine and the boosters against omicron?"
6442,Maybe they should get another booster… since the previous shots helped
6443,In the Philippines it spread in less than a week that explains why incubation period is just 2 days
6444,"How many boosters until the body responds negatively to constant stimulation of the immune system?  My coworker was fine with her first and second dose. After the booster, she developed hives over parts of her body that have subsided and resurfaced for the last six weeks...on her arms, chest, under the hair. It seems to be an immune response and her body has finally had enough. Multiple boosters this close together have not been researched for safety...it&#39;s all a guessing game and doesn&#39;t seem to have been terribly effective for Israel."
6445,People who havent had their 3rd shot are classified as unvaccinated..so i wonder how many of them are in hospital and what their exact reasons for being hospitalised 🤔Anyways God bless you all in Israel 💖🍀🙏

6448,"If the country population has 3 shots, the death rates is low, just let it roll, live your life normally and forget the pandemic...it&#39;s time to do that, If not now, when?"
6449,They only need 6 more booster shots to flatten the curve
6450,Time to trust your own immune system and get healthy.
6451,We&#39;ve pretty much stopped testing and vaccinating and self isolating or hiding away
6452,"At this rate, they will be a 10th booster shot by end of year"

6464,"Wow! It really has sky-rocketed! Previously, Israel peaked at about 10000 new cases a day in all previous waves... now they are at 30000 new daily cases, and climbing!<br><br>That 4th prick they are rolling out is working well 🤣"
6465,"In the piece showing Israeli health care workers, I noticed that they wear a face shield.<br>As someone who has long worn glasses, I wonder whether  eye protection  would be more effective at preventing infection through the eyes?"
6466,"There s no point of a fourth booster. That s just unbelievable. By the time you take 1 booster, your body should have enough antibodies."

6474,"The bottom line is...<br>The better prepared, the faster the response. The faster the response, the less damage done. <br> Vaccines ARE preparation for the immune system."
6475,Maybe they should get a 5th booster since they are working so well.
6476,"Sorry, my family and I are not interested in getting more shots. For my elderly parents, 2 jabs was so taxing on their health already, they&#39;re just planning to take their chances with natural immunity instead."
6477,Maybe continually showing needles going into arms isn’t the best way to focus attention on the serious questions of how one manages the Omicron surge?
6478,Is there any point repeating the same report for every damn country? It carries as much information as saying the sun rose over the Pacific in Japan today

6526,so this country close the school and let the other business open for two years? that&#39;s really smart choice indeed.
6527,It&#39;s not alone. Our young people are suffering from 2 years of disrupted education. We should have done more to get all children back into school.

A Pandemic, political unrest. social unrest, growing inequality."

6548,They are doing quite well considering less than 10 million (rough estimate) people in lockdown out of the population of 1.4 billions. That’s less than 1% of their population.
6549,"Basically, if China lockdown for 2 cases, they are considered as too harsh as it is not severe.  And if China lockdown for a few thousand cases, they are still considered as too harsh and everyone should put sanction on them."
6550,I honestly want someone to do a story on why there’s so many Australians at DW lol
6551,Just FYI <br>DW was asking the same question back in 2020
6552,"Honest, put political and racist reasons aside, China have done very well. We should all learn from them."
6553,"Maintaining zero tolerance to covid has been a responsible action taken by the Chinese government. It has prevented many deaths and suffering. You can choose other path, but you don’t need to wish others ill."
6554,Chinese do not expect to maintain zero Covid but buy the time. When proper drugs or vaccines are found or when Covid is like a flu they will change their policy.
6555,"An excellent opportunity to observe a social science experiment that would, under normal circumstances, be deemed as &#39;unethical&#39;."
6556,"I hope you will keep producing the COVID-19 specials.  I found your channel during the 2020 lockdown, appreciating the European focus (I live in the US), and in particular appreciated the depth of reporting about the virus. I know it’s calendar year 3, and maybe Derrick is tired of questions…but I hope you keep producing those reports!"
6557,This Chinese journalist&#39;s English speaking is so good. I bet he can get band 9 on IELTS.
6558,"Well, Germany has failed miserably……"
6559,"Really DW? The topic is the covid tests for the whole city in China, which has happened so many times, and the half of this video is about its real intention and geopolitical strategy with the olympics, because the city is nearby? You guys really take the effort to make the others look nasty. Greeting from Germany, mit Fremdschäme."
6560,"Of course it is merely about the image and, you know, the Olympics. Which is why DW invites a political journalist working for the WSJ as an expert on public health and infectious disease issues, since, as we all know, Olympics is merely a political event to show off national pride, but disguised as a sports event. And WSJ is the most trustworthy source on China and public health issues, since these issues are nothing but politics and financial markets."
6561,"This Omicron spread so fast. That will be interesting to see if they manage to contain it this time.<br>I hope they have been able to vaccinate enough people in the country to at least give the first layer of protection in case it gets out of hand. Just making it like a flu.<br>I hear that the chinese vaccines are even less effective than Pfizer/Moderna against Omicron, but it looks like all vaccines help to avoid most worst cases."
6562,May be this is the best way to stop corona if not every year we get new varient and new mutation
6563,"Excellent job to avoid the population in china be infected. Less than 100 infections by omicron, less than 100 !!!!!!, it was astonishing. Excellent job china. How many persons are infected in europe or in germany by the way???"
6564,"Zero COVID policy works perfectly in China, we may be afraid of that millions of Chinese people are temporarily restricted to take COVID test or may experience quarantine somewhere in China sometime, however for majority of Chinese people, they are pretty safe and free. Let us analyze it from perspective of data and take US and China as comparison, including the factor of freedom and quarantine, the quarantine in China can be defined as &quot;temporarily loosing freedom of going out for 2~3 weeks, normally stay at home or hotel room but with full support from community&quot;. In US, the average daily case is around 66207K/730 =90k, with all time freedom, and in China, the average daily case is only 104745/730=143, the average daily quarantined people is estimated to 300K, when it is calculated based on 1.4 billion Chinese people, firstly the average rate of daily case is 143/1400000000 = 0.0001%,  that can be ignored, and the average daily rate to be quarantined in China is estimated to be 300K/1400000K = 0.021%, compared with US&#39;s average rate of CORVID case 90k/330000k=0.027%, we can see that &quot;the probability to be quarantined in China&quot; is less than &quot;the probability to get CORVID in US&quot;, which results from that China is taking Zero COVID policy while US is not. Basically speaking, Zero COVID policy is successful, it changed a lot of persons from &quot;getting COVID&quot; status to just &quot;being quarantined&quot; status in terms of real result, which can also be proved by some international travelers once lived in US and now living in China.  (Note: Here I assume average daily people being quarantined is around 300K, this is rough estimation, during peak time it might be more than 10 millions, however there contains most time period close to only hundreds of persons being quarantined. I am just afraid that the average data of being quarantined might be overestimated).<br><br><br>Moreover, this special policy causes me to recall the Harvard lecture about &quot;Justice-what is the right thing to do&quot;(Harvard lecture does not represent rightness, but really contains deep thinking that I would like to measure with). For reality in China, there exists the situation that some one need to scarify 2~3 weeks period of freedom(Being quarantined but with full support from surrounding, not too bad) to prevent another one person from getting CORVID virus, if these two persons are designated by someone with personal judgement, that will be unfair or unjust, but when we look into the fact that who will be who is actually random, and it is based on probability, the process is public and clear, it does not violate human&#39;s equality, instead it well meets Chinese moral principles that a lot of lives are saved, thus, the Zero COVID policy is quite fair and just to every people living or staying in China, and the result of this policy to fight against virus and keep people healthy is quite good as well."
6565,Omicron is already in a lot of parts in  China..nothing can stop it!
6566,"Well, it is hard. But have to. 1st it’s the stable policy and 2nd in lieu with the huge population."
6567,The USA should test all of the 20 million people in the NY state.
6568,If they do that means they have the antidote
6569,There&#39;s something worst coming they know if I live this out I&#39;ll see
6570,Asia is super strict. But at least they can have big New Year celebrations and all other of their holidays including Christmas and Oktoberfest. xD
6571,When did they have 0 covid in the first place 😂
6572,For the sake of His sorrowful Passion have mercy on us and on the whole world.
6573,Zero COVID policy sounds optimistic but unrealistic for a country with 1.4 billion people lol.

6580,China can maintain the zero case policy but it’s not a good one in the long run as it is an open country that trades with other countries and cases will be imported. Zero case policy has a huge mental and economic impact to the country and its people.

6639,It&#39;s impossible to maintain something you never had
6640,"Every country has it own strategy to handle crisis or covid. China chosed &quot;zero covid&quot; policy becoz there are many mega cities inside China, with population over 10 million. if covid spreads out, it would be disaster and that is why China sticks to &quot;zero covid&quot; policy from the very begining of 2020, not becoz that winter Olympics is coming soon..my personal experience is that ppl shall cooperate with government to control virus, it is like climate change, to make better environment is not only about government effort also concern with indivisual behavior, therefore media platform shall do more  documentary film or TV adverts to educate citizen...if media platform is full of conspiracy theory about virus or anti covid control policy, it will lead in division, and further cause damage on public health."
6641,God&#39;s love is the flower -  Mercy the fruit <br>&quot;Let the doubting soul read these considerations on Divine Mercy and become trusting.&quot;         (from the Diary of Saint Faustina Kowalska; 949) ...  and the considerations follow  ...
6642,"In a nutshell, fear Allaah the One, the Overpowering as you have reached the year of major incidents.<br>Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni<br>02- January - 2022 AD<br><br> <br>bQZNER"
6643,Lol why does anyone believe them?
6644,"One need not be a fan of the Chinese government to appreciate how great they are at dealing with this crisis. In the West, there are entitled people running amok, throwing tantrums on the street."
6645,We should all follow Chinas amazing control of its subjects. NOT.
6646,They been at out hous all day and nighht
6647,"One set of rules for the rich and famous, and another set for the rest of us."
6648,Boot him out! We spend months in lockdown and now celebrity gets a free pass!
6649,They give an exemption to a non citizen and enforce rules with citizens ??? Crazy.
6650,"Australia, not just a police state - but a full, 3 ring circus at the same time"
6651,I wish we couldn&#39;t hear all the sounds in the studio so loudly while somebody is reporting via video call.
6652,Remember when all you needed to get into Australia was a criminal record?
6653,Hahaha Scott Morrison said Rules are rules! And the Australian Boarders are doing their job. But the judge said they are not. What are joke
6654,This decision will ultimately backfired for the govt.
6655,"So, if a non-EU citizen can enter Australia unvaccinated, I suppose EU citizens can too."
6656,so there are equal and more equal. disgrace for all the people who follow all the restrictions and dont have assets and support of someone like Novak.
6657,"Look on the bright side, we&#39;re going to get an honest government ad video out of this very soon."
6658,It&#39;s impossible find justice in a world where criminal makes all the laws !
6659,"Nick kyrious, and Andy Murray, out of the other players come out in support of him."
6660,I&#39;m in limbo but nobody is talking about it. Money bought Justice. Kangaroo court no wonder
6661,“Many of life’s failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.”
6662,I  don’t know how Prime Minister Scott Morrison will react in to this. A slap on his face and his government. Rules are rules he said. What now??
6663,Personally I supported 💯 % NOVAK as a sportsmanship. Medical of point view.  I can’t talk about it.
6664,"So if you&#39;re rich and famous, Australian law does not apply to you. WOW"
6665,"Top sportsman should never, ever get involved in celebrating fascists who killed thousands of innocent people.Shame on you novak."
6666,Talk back radio in Australia will make the final decision tomorrow. And the Federal government facing an election this year will carry out that decision.
6667,So if you are VIP - covid restricts does not apply to you
6668,Do not be bamboozled into making your health decisions.
6669,"Scotty has home court advantage, Novak brings it back to deuce."
6670,Why Novak can enterwhen Australian cannot return to Australia ?
6671,You headline should br...  he won the case....
6672,This sounds like something that would happen in South Africa… The law doesn’t apply for ALL people
6673,He is not exempt from the laws of government.
6674,"Reminds me of that reality TV show about Australian border control, how it&#39;s all a load of BS, the only decisive factor of your entry into Australia is how rich you are and how good your lawyer is. Money is above the law when it comes to Australian border control."
6675,"Unless you are Daniil Medvedev, Djokovic is telling everybody else &quot;Nothing can stop ME!&quot;"
6676,All you need is money and a lawyer. Regular people of course cannot get to Australia without vaccination.
6677,That&#39;s ✅
6678,He should be ashamed! He should never be able to get that visa and not be allowed to play.
6679,Just let him play or pay for his flight back home ...jeez
6680,"Rules are rules... If he is allowed to stay, he stays"
6681,Justice and righteousness are heavenly mandates and will sooner than later catch up and prevail over those who are claiming and welding those only human mandate
6682,"So, will he recieve some compensation for that week of slavery?"
6683,Australian Supreme Court ruling may just be B;.S if Attorney General over rules it..Australia law is it a joke or does it have substance??
6684,The rules are not for all. What’s new about that?
6685,He thinks he is bigger than the sport and bigger than the law of the land.
6686,Novak definitely won&#39;t be collapsing on court.
6687,Yay! Money wins! &quot;Tennis player flanked by attorneys&quot; is the way i picture sports champions!
6688,Hahahahahaha<br>Gov lost the lawsuit and now will just make up a new law to stop him<br><br>Rule of law doesn&#39;t even exist thefe
6689,&quot;Novac &quot; says his name  - now thats a Djok
6690,The important question now is does he have COVID ?
6691,Australian government looking very amateur and silly.
6692,you don&#39;t need to follow the disease law if you&#39;re famous or rich
6693,This good publicity for tennis meaning more viewership in turn more advert revenues while majority of plebeians keep arguing on here instead of improving their personal lives
6694,"Lol people calling his situation inhumane when people have been begging to be allowed back into the country for 2 years (to visit sick family, attend funerals / weddings, etc.) and if they’re lucky enough to be granted entry all have done the 14-day gov’t hotel quarantine as well. Why is it such a problem for the rich guy and not the millions of others over the past years?"
6695,Austrslia  Rules are Rules  has been ruined by &quot;Discrimination Australian Court Order&quot;. All players of Australian Open and Anybody who come to Australia need no follow the  &quot;Australian Government Rules of Covid-19 Requirements&quot;. If didn&#39;t ? DISCRIMINATION LAW &amp; ORDER of Aussie court.
6696,"Lots of people crying now, because he wasn&#39;t boosted like them."
6697,"And as an Asian, even upon declaration that I do not have FOOD in my luggage, I get my bags check all. The. Time."
6698,Preferential treatment for for a VIP. The law should be for everyone.
6699,"Instead of singling out Novak as the source of all evil, the government should take greater focus on advising individuals who experience any symptoms (no matter how mild) to self-isolate and behave accordingly. This is to prevent further spread of the virus and thus show consideration for other members of our society. I support the decision of the wise judge!"
6700,Novak for the win! 🥇🏆🥇🏆🥇🥇🏆🥇🏆🥇🥇🇷🇸🇷🇸🇷🇸
6701,"To argue to let a tennis player into Australia without requiring that he comply with the regulations we ask all guests to follow seems like a suggestion that we introduce a two tier system; one system for privileged people who hit a ball for a living, and another set of regulations for everyone else.  And let’s look back to this tennis player’s recent history regarding behaviour and beliefs regarding Coronavirus.<br><br>I also find it a little strange to have a smirking discussion with a tennis commentator regarding legal proceedings underlying a visa challenge by a sovereign country.  Wouldn’t it be more relevant to discuss with a lawyer or suchlike?  Whether we speak of the Bundesregierung or the Australian Federal Government, all immigration ministers have the ability to veto a visa, and in this case, it would be reasonable."
6702,"Stick your regulations in that place! All of you complaining about your miserable life and procjecting it to a tennis player..he gets to walk free, i m still locked up and they keep jabbing me..Keep obbeying! Next one will be shortages and maybe alines..Oh yeah enjoy Flurona🤣🤣"
6703,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENKFUe_JEBw&amp;t=4m15s"">4:15</a> Fascinating Indeed!!! Nothing like two opposing sides using the same reasoning (&quot;I&#39;m whyte and I say so!&quot;) to get their way..."
6704,So they detained him until visa expired
6705,Australia is just trying to look tough again that&#39;s all.
6706,Who would’ve guessed the Djoker would be Secret Santa for the news media first thing in 2022?!
6707,I would refuse to play.
6708,Tennis is above the Australian law.
6709,Does any really believe there is any medical reason for this threatment of Djokovic?
6710,"“No special rules for Djokavic! Of course unless the courts disagree with us, in which case we will find any reason whatsoever to cancel his visa.” <br>These obvious hypocrisies are going to cost governments all around the world their power."
6711,"Atleast when China detain a tennis star, they are competent.  To be fair, the Australian government is new at this communist thing. Novak is a hero."
6712,He&#39;s been arrested now
6713,Australian ATAGI rules say immunity after infection last 6 months
6714,"Send him back. Why should he be treated differently and get away with providing false information? Liar! Stop playing dumb and be grateful.  You can’t make people respect you, you have to earn the respect."
6715,So is he gonna play or not?
6716,If it was different I would lose my trust in humanity.
6717,This person should have been deported the moment his visa is cancelled period. I am not an Australian but it&#39;s not fair for the australian citizens to be subjected like this if they violate covid rules. Do not be swayed being of his status in society for crying out loud. AUSTRALIA stick to your rules he can come back to AUSTRALIA if he gets vaccination!
6718,"This situation has nothing to do with vaccines, tennis or visas ... only Rio Tinto !!!"
6719,Jokevic 😄...pack his racket and send him home ASAP
6720,"The unvaccinated can&#39;t attend the game as an audience member, but he or she can sure as heck play in the tournament. Haha, Australia needs to fix this quickly."
6721,So he goes from a 3 star hotel to a 5 star hotel. Who gives a damn.
6722,bookmakers had bet on his lose and  don&#39;t let him to participate  whatsoever) easy money!
6723,Novak ❤
6724,Regular people would&#39;ve been sent home the same day.
6725,How Australians are acting is classic Stockholm syndrome
6726,What a Princess..and it&#39;s not over yet ..
6727,Minister of immigration advices she still holds discretionary power
6728,Election votes can be lost if the government is made to look silly. Voters are watching what actions government will take to evict Novak.
6729,As an Australian living oversee&#39;s i can say the Government has had an absolute shocker here and heads need to role.
6730,Preferential treatment. Such an embarrassment
6731,Thats why he hasn&#39;t just left because he knows once he leaves hes not welcome back for 3 years. Like that other tennis player who was deported she will be banned for 3 years. That means no aus open for novak for 3 years.
6732,Novakcine No&#39;Djokovic
6733,НАПРЕД СРБИЈА<br>ПОЗДРАВ ОД МАКЕДОНИЈА
6734,What is the problem with the government? What do they against the tennis player?
6735,"Victory,looks like Australians are living the next Totalitarian regime."
6736,Let tennis ALONE.
6737,Money always wins
6738,"How pathetic, regardless of the specific topic, we&#39;re once shown again that if you&#39;re rich you stand above the law. If it was a normal citizen breaking the rules we would be sent back on the next plane.<br><br>Pathetic Australia."
6739,AUSSIES  are showing the world that<br>not all of them disagree with NOLI however<br>at the end of the day... immigration will stick<br>to their MANDATE. WHAT DO YOU THINK?
6740,"That&#39;s a complete demoralization. And believe me, being from Brasil I know what demoralization looks like. At least when it comes to VIPs Australia and Brasil are on the same page. The message is clear: Novax Djokovid is VIP and he may come and go as he pleases, but you, mere mortal, you can not."
6741,Crazy Australia😅😅
6742,Natural immunity never???
6743,In China Novak Djokovic will disappear.
6744,😊Oh lordy!
6745,Nole run from there. Run for your  life. I am scared what they might be able to do to him
6746,A justice system  for the rich and another one for the rest !  Money buys everything!
6747,Really leaves me speechless what is going on in this country!
6748,Stores in Atlanta are out of masks.  Everyone here seemed to think the new variant would be mild and that was it.  More people wear masks now in public than during the height of Delta.
6749,"My husband has covid right now and we are vaccinated with 2 Moderna vaccines.  No booster.  He said it feels like the flu with a tequila hangover.  He is 50.  Symptoms are headache throbbing, chills, fever of 102 and body aches"
6750,"A bit sensationalist numbers rose very quickly but  in London the number of new cases are going down,  very  rapidly , in Scotland new cases  are passed peak and going down.<br>Average hospital stays for those Omicron cases  who become inpatients  are roughly half what they were in the Delta waves."
6751,It&#39;s so sad to watch this news. I pray that those infected can recover sooner. Please take care and stay safe everyone
6752,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL6faklxVqY&amp;t=0m47s"">0:47</a> this nurse opened the door with her back &amp; closed it with her palm 😁"
6753,"The hospitals are experiencing a crisis because staff are calling off work due to testing positive for COVID, NOT because there are a record number of severe infections. When adjusted for this, COVID mortality rates and ICU admissions have actually remained stagnant in the UK due to Omicron&#39;s mild symptoms. And from recent trends, the UK has already passed its peak with regards to cases/infections."
6754,I feel so sorry for the UK poor old girl we need help send us doctors from Germany please 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️.
6755,"We shouldn&#39;t use official covid death&#39;s as a metric. Look at excess deaths. The ecconmist have a good report on it, the uk isn&#39;t actually that bad when looking at it in that way  especially compared to Russia or Italy per captia."
6756,"Wherever our vaccination status , is a Real virus,a treat,we all are vulnerable🙏🕯"
6757,"Funny how they’re now saying there is no pressure , and that we are living with it 🤣"
6758,"A friend of mine got deltasigma...<br><br>Seriously ill...<br><br>Doesn&#39;t like to to party, self isolation, to be honest, I am worried.<br><br><br>He was a different person   ....<br><br>This covid desease...."
6759,"were 120,000 of those deaths the ones from the care homes? I remember they sent many contaminated people there."
6760,Its only a matter of time till there&#39;d another variant and the cycle repeats.
6761,"Interesting times indeed, things are very different for them now.  Not likely to improve"
6762,"368,000 cases in France yesterday,  there is the crisis.   UK is outpacing the rest of the Northern Hemisphere and is likely to be out of the pandemic, with covid being endemic in UK according to top scientists."
6763,"Coronavirus? Ok what strains? Exact mutations? By not being direct, your leaving room for misinterpretation."
6764,"Results indicate that stenoparib possesses strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in vitro. This activity appears to be based on multiple modes of action, where both pre-entry and postentry viral replication processes are impeded. This may provide a therapeutic advantage over many current options that have a narrower target range. Moreover, our results suggest that stenoparib and remdesivir in combination may be especially potent against coronavirus infection."
6765,It’s not at full stretch only some nhs trusts are struggling
6766,Interesting how omicron affects the UK as apposed to here in South Africa
6767,May God come to the rescue 🙏 🙌 ✨ ❤
6768,"We’re in deep manure here in Australia then, our hospitals here in Brisbane are like this with patients waiting in ambulances before the virus arrived and the cases are just starting to take off now! Add to that our immune systems are naive when it comes to Covid-19 and we have only just started booster shots."
6769,&quot;I should have listened&quot; Yes you should and you should also be made to apologise to the poor sods stuck waiting in ambulances outside the hospital because you are taking up a place unnecessarily.
6770,People don’t learn ... legit they don’t.
6771,"According to the Office of National Statistics 17,500 have died from covid and only covid"
6772,"Why don&#39;t you start stating death rates per head per population. Both Italy and Belgium have higher death rates per head per population, as do many Eastern European countries where some states are much higher."
6773,It&#39;s nothing. We are hitting 1 mil soon. RIP!
6774,Why do I always get the feeling that they keep mixing up cases with deaths?🤔
6775,Love how the morbidity among those that &quot;almost died&quot; from covid is never mentioned. I am sure covid is the threat for that lady...
6776,boris johnson&#39;s hair is the real crisis.<br>people are dying hysterically at his hair.
6777,"Wow, the funeral directors are overwhelm with so many dead. Will check if the funeral directors are looking for to hire new staff. Its winter people will died of the the common flu on a yearly basis. The healthcare has always been understaffed for years."
6778,"They reckon it&#39;s now past its peak ?...well maybe for London..but as it spreads to each county , these too will have a rise that won&#39;t see their peaks for at least a month later.<br>How come London is the only data they seem to recognise.."
6779,But you kept saying its milder than delta! Wonder how many died thanks to words they heard every day from your hosts! Sad!
6780,That lady nurse’s way of opening that door was very bizarre in many ways!
6781,Deaths top 150k? In 2 years? How many people die every year in UK?
6782,It supposed to be mild I remember
6783,Citizens protest against the civil servants who are no longer controlled by the citizen as the legitimate ruler and sole sovereign.
6784,I thought the UK was over with pandemic... Why even bother?
6785,The headline is a a flat out lie and everybody knows it.
6786,Congs! especially for the unvaccinated ones 👀🤔
6787,Surprisingly Maximum people died in the hospital ..but people hardly  died at home or even on the  street .. ..and still they r bleming unvaccinated..
6788,"Learn from Africa where only fewer people are relatively vaccinated compared to Europe, but has fewer numbers of Covid-19 active cases."
6789,Of course the UK is very good at counting deaths. Unlike many European and other continents. In some countries its very hard to die of covid because of the rules set in place in order to be counted on the list and in others they don&#39;t have the infrastructure to be accurate. Sometimes it doesn&#39;t pay to be honest.
6790,There needs to be a lockdown
6791,Britain is the entry point for Delta and omicron then spread around Europe and beyond.
6792,What a drama news message on something that’s coming at an end.
6793,They sure know how to use a &quot;crisis&quot;
6794,We live in exciting times
6795,Pandemic of the &#39;elderly &amp; the overweight&#39;
6796,This is the highest death count in the UK
6797,Omicron is burning itself out pretty quickly
6798,"Wow, 150,000 is a lot, poor souls..........but lets not worry about the 8+ million children who&#39;ve starved to death during covid"
6799,I dont understand when i was growing up i learned that russia was europe so?...
6800,These deaths aren’t real😳It’s a conspiracy
6801,that&#39;s a pretty low death rate compared to tons of other countries. good luck UK.
6802,"It doesn&#39;t seem right  a member of the public calls all others (unvaxed) as &quot;Selfish&quot; when this is clearly a two sided coin. To only hear of one side is to support it without hearing or acknowledging another. How ever you reached your decision (vaxed or unvaxed) I support you, I may or may not personally agree or disagree. I respect that it&#39;s ours to make in peace. People should not be condemned for it. I would hope DW-News would take responsibility for different view points both in and out of professional circles."
6803,At the rate that this is spreading it should be burned out by summer let&#39;s hope so!
6804,And they say &quot;Most&quot; people this information comes from Doctors who are full of boo. Liars.
6805,"Amazing how the person who wrote his scare tactic monologue went from 150,000 deaths to Omicron....yet given how weak omicron is,....it probably contributed to very few of those 150,000. Anything to scare people"
6806,🙏🙏🙏
6807,"There’s no stopping or slowing this thing; better to focus energy and efforts on how best to live with it - two years of trying and failing (with the exception of momentary, superficial wins) has taught us that.  The vaccine is great, but more effort needs to be put into therapeutic treatments and testing for antibodies - regardless of how they’re acquired."
6808,"Numbers of patients in high care and ICU at time of writing<br>UK 868<br>Germany 4,636<br>France 3,333<br>Spain 2,005<br>Italy 1,595<br>Figures from roylab stats"
6809,"This is an almost sureal report, people are just getting on with their lives now, especially in London.  Seems like a propergander hit job. As a Londoner I can tell you, things are pretty normal now, people are going out, sports are being played, and yes hospitals are struggling (this happens almost every winter!)"
6810,"Put the freaking timeframe ! 150,000 since the beginning of the pandemic.  If yes. Make it explicit"
6811,It was only 48 deaths a few days ago.<br><br>What is the source of this manupilated source?
6812,"346 deaths reported today 26-01-2022 and lifting restrictions isn’t good, mind you this PM isn’t going to be PM for much longer as nothing is going well for him, and he hasn’t done himself any favours by lying when questioned about most things, he the PM has a problem telling the truth, where his colleagues have or been seen to not say anything but the photographs have, even animals from Kabul have taken priority over people, he has to step down before Russia break into the Ukraine as I wouldn’t wish him being PM whilst we are in conflict."
6813,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL6faklxVqY&amp;t=0m48s"">0:48</a> she still touches the handle… 😅"
6814,the thing they don&#39;t tell us is..... did they die of covid or did they die from something ealse with covid..
6815,Not many news covering the recent death rate on uk omicron spike
6816,"It&#39;s all a game to them so please help me to understand why so many take these theatricals serious.  We&#39;ve all been had, it&#39;s been happening for years and years, yet we continue to keep feeding them. <br>They are still laughing at us all, just as they have over the last 2 years, lies, smoke and mirrors, illusions, false inaccurate data, fear, deception and corruption, they never took it seriously, it was only the fear and seriousness of our beliefs in THIER system that have got us to this point.  Ask yourself now... If they were never worried about the severity of this &quot;pandemic&quot; why on earth were we?"
6817,Keep in mind the UK has a population that is 15 Million lower then the one in Germany.
6818,Enough of this farce already!!
6819,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL6faklxVqY&amp;t=0m44s"">0:44</a>  How NOT to open a door .. use you backside twice then grab the handle!  What is that all about?"
6820,"people in uk eat unhealthy food , that is the main problem."
6821,"This is so sad. I feel bad for people who are elderly &amp; immunocompromised and vaccinated and are getting ill. They needed the rest of us to get vaccinated and distance. I didn&#39;t get together with family with the holidays, many did and are paying the price. Unvaccinated people taking up beds &amp; staff that people with other severe, emergent conditions could use is also really sad."
6822,"&quot;The more you increase fear..., the more you control all the people &quot;.<br>  -Naom Chomsky"
6823,Roll on the scaremongering in order to make the public frightened
6824,China really needs to pay the price..
6825,"I&#39;m so scared I&#39;m going to live in the cupboard<br>thanks for looking out for me dw views, you have my best interests at heart"
6826,This title and thumbnail is very misleading
6827,"Solution: when a non-covid patient arrives at a hospital and there are no available beds for them, take a random non-vaccinated patient from their bed and give it to the person with priority."
6828,RIP little england
6829,Boris the butcher should be held responsible &amp; gov to account.
6830,It’s not a crisis! Omicron is mild!
6831,"remember to thank Tedros and Xi Ping for the last 2 years of death, unemployment and the spread of draconian rhetoric."
6832,"The Covid death number is almost 10 times higher than Japan, although UK only have half of the population."
6833,"Best way to have avoided 150,000 deaths with Covid not of Covid necessarily is to test less as most other countries do."
6834,UK population nearly 70 million - so nearly 0.2% have died. Hmmmn
6835,"I live in UK, the climate here is too humid, which provides viruses an opportunity to spread with little difficulties. That’s the main reason why UK is hit so hard by the pandemic."
6836,It&#39;s sad  Mr borris
6837,"Over 172,000 people have died in the UK (officially) with covid-19 as cause on their death certificate"
6838,😳😳🙏🙏
6839,Please separate years. You just keep adding. Just to scare 😱 people.
6840,How muchnof the death is caused by omicron?
6841,Do not matter what language speech dat you can’t not speak they as well needs to let there voice be speaking
6842,"Get vaccinated everyone, every man vaccinated empties much needed beds!"
6843,The decade of covid
6844,I believe  A joint In the morning is a saver for me and all the smokers I know.. we don&#39;t get covid... maybe they should test marihuana as medicine....?
6845,With all the Jabs and mask wearing how come Hospitals are over crowded
6846,Grandpa got omicron the entire house followed.
6847,I cant believe my eyes and ears ... things have gotten so absurd
6848,Shout out to all my fellow hermits enjoying this time in history
6849,Always wanted to visit Germany. Guess I never will now ...and I am fine with that. I won&#39;t support tyranny.
6850,This decision is a mistake in my opinion.
6851,Good for Germany! ❤️
6852,Insane. So many said they would help fight oppression only to become the oppressor by their passive behaviour
6853,"How come a &quot;state leader&quot; can just decide how many people have to be vaccinated? This should be a medical decision, not a quota decided by state bureaucrats."
6854,Why lifting restriction on boosted people? they can catch omicron just as well? have learn nothing from the Delta wave?
6855,"Not eating at restaurants because I&#39;m not vaccinated has actually helped me save a lot of money. But if I&#39;m not allowed to work, that is irrelevant"
6856,Will it end at the 3rd booster? Or will it be an infinite boosters?
6857,People really need to WAKE-UP
6858,"In the tiny nation of Portugal cafés and restaurants are Open schools,night clubs,barstools are going to open as well next week just to keep the population calm and happy, clients need a negative test to enter the premises,because Portugal is having elections for a new government and prime minister and even the infected with the virus will be allowed to vote at poll stations!!!"
6859,"Is it ok to wear a mask under the nose like that lady making sure everyone is folowing the rules , isnt that a bit dumb ?"
6860,Guys .. let it go .. you can’t stop omicron .. might as well leave it and hope for the best. This lock down stuff is getting ridiculous
6861,"When you have had you weekly booster and show your papers you can do as you wish, despite the fact you are infectious. Are you fighting the virus or humanity."
6862,Stay safe...good luck &amp; healthy for Germany 🇩🇪 population
6863,"In Canada, Bear Lake, the government has ignored please for help...massive case load over a week.<br>The government is approaching a final solution mentality due to incompetence and mismanagement."
6864,Hahahahahaha....Only boostered can visit restaurants....Oh what a science.....
6865,"Tightening the Cvoid rules means nothing unless people are convinced that they are responsible for curbing the spread of the virus.  Besides unless someone that violates the measures is caught and proven to have violated the measures and appropriately dealt with, there is no way to prove that the covid measures are observed or not."
6866,So you can leave quarantine after 7 days with a negative PCR test on the 7th day? So still 14 days. I have waited more than 7 days for the result of my PCR test on 31/12.
6867,"Thank God, I don&#39;t eat in restaurants.  I eat only freshly cooked food and that too only by myself."
6868,Must be depressing being a German.
6869,South Africa is back to normal everything is open omicron is going away
6870,Still trying to control what exactly.  Getting boosted for that probable 34 percent efficacy benefit is so sketchy at best. Everyone is still catching it. … Target the high risk only if anything and Omicron is mostly mild. These politicians are stuck in a loop.
6871,"Starting when are the new regulations enacted? If the time for the booster jab didn&#39;t come yet, do people still need to make a test to go to a restaurant?"
6872,"Its too late for all this measures, soon Europe will declare states of emergency. Most in icu is fully vaccinated, Boris Johnson,  I’m sorry to say this but the overwhelming majority of people who are currently ending up in intensive care in our hospitals are people who are not boosted,” he said. “I’ve talked to doctors who say the numbers are running up to 90% of people in intensive care.”"
6873,My roommate had booster shot last month and he is currently covid positive for the last 1 week or so. So it does not make sense to treat people without the 3rd shot differently.
6874,Gigantic overreaction. And unethical with Delta also still around. Let Omicron rip!
6875,How does this impact people that are not supposed to get their 3rd shot yet? I had my second shot in late August and from what I can see I am not supposed to get the booster until late February (6 months). If possible I will try to get the booster in early February.
6876,Restrictions have been doing very little when it comes to this Omicron strain. I live in Florida where there is no restrictions and almost everyone I know is catching this at the same time. The good news though is how mild this strain is. Hospitals are not seeing many sick people. I currently have it myself right now unfortunately but it is so mild compared to delta.
6877,what happens to those who had the third booster shots yet have caught covid?
6878,"first the unvaxx, now the unboostered. do you see a pattern?"
6879,I wouldn&#39;t bother myslelf to go through so much hassle to go to restaurant. It&#39;s stick and carrot 🥕 tactic.
6880,We in South Africa did not worry with boosters we rather get omicron it&#39;s mild and recover 3 days only then it goes away
6881,"I&#39;m happy to watch each and every business bleed money by keeping my money and not spend it at any cafe, restaurant, or venue requiring me to be &#39;boosted&#39;."
6882,"This hardly makes sense in light of the fact that break through infections are a prominent concern with the omicron variant. Of the roughly 70 original cases of omicron in Indonesia, at least 90% were fully vaccinated, ranging from Moderna to Coronavac and presumably they were also infectious.  Then in Germany it&#39;s been reported that there aren&#39;t enough doses of vaccine for those who want or need to have primary vaccinations or boosters. This policy will undoubtedly be unpopular with the public because it&#39;s not fair to punish people who have diligently been vaccinated or wish to be but are waiting for the government. Instead sanction the vaccine makers for making less than effective vaccines and then artificially forcing people to wait in the name of intellectual property rights."
6883,Good luck Germany 🙈
6884,"Same in Austria but also masks outside if u can’t keep 2m distance is possible, numbers r low except the skiing in Tyrol areas are going through the roof, the Brit’s came skiing."
6885,"I am German, not Vaccinated but fully healthy. I have to test myself every day at a official test place to be allowed to work. I cant even walk inside a Hardware Store without being vaccinated."
6886,"What happened to the gelb/rote ampel system?!  Future lockdowns were supposed to based upon the availability of ICU beds / hospital beds but a week or 2 ago, the Munich status website stopped showing the ampels. What up?!?!"
6887,I want to see the video of police going through a restaurant checking everyone for vaccine papers.
6888,Why so many broadcasters mispronounce omicron and pronounce it “ omnicron” ?!
6889,"@DW what about those who took single shot J&amp;J and then booster, does that count as 2 or 3?"
6890,Before entering into bars  any one needs to be tested . If u r negative then u can surely be allowed to entertain ur self.
6891,&quot;Heads off&quot; the corrupt governments
6892,“Economy before health” is a better title for this video
6893,They had a chance to act months ago... but now it&#39;s too little too late
6894,"This isn&#39;t a solution simply because nobody can tell how many shots is enough to call off the pandemic due to the fact that it&#39;s not working. This isn&#39;t life ,it&#39;s madness. Who wants to go to restaurants or anywhere for that matter when all the joy is destroyed by all that pointless stuff around."
6895,It is not Germany to impose restrictions. It&#39;s the brotherhood. The big brother.
6896,Notice they didn&#39;t stop collecting taxpayer money or even slow down on spending it
6897,This is outrageous. Wake up people!
6898,"New leader has new measures, but no long plans, cause he cares only cases in his service years."

6905,So ridiculous. One doesn’t ‘get control of omicron’ - it’s now endemic.
6906,Wondering how the govs make decisions to push the third job of the pharma vaccine where the omicron itself works as a vaccine. (South Africa studies) probably to meet the contracts for the following jabs .

7044,"Es muss endlich eine endgültige Antwort für die Coronazis geben, um sie in ein Zentrum zur Quarantäne und Heilung auszusiedeln. Dafür wäre eine allgemeine Vermögenserklärung und eine Leugnerkartei sinnvoll. Als erstes müssen dazu Auffangzentren geschaffen werden, zur anschließenden Umsiedlung. Später kann das dann auf weitere Individuen zur Abbeförderung ausgedehnt werden."
7045,Fear is the virus. Love and Freedom is the cure.
7046,What is it.....let everyone get ocron and leave us alone. We dont lockdown countries and have border and vaccine mandate (unless you a doctor) for endemic diseases. SO!!!!
7047,Now we got more problems and omicron made hospitals around the world difficult times and there’s been major shortages of everything around the world
7048,so many crazy Q type people here. I miss when dw had reasonably intelligent people commenting.
7049,"Be patient, DW! We are in the middle of omicron only.  It will take some weeks, if not months, before we reach Omega variants."
7050,"Informative, good reporting journalism... press the like button then watch the video, always... 👏💖"
7051,"Don&#39;t feel too bad UK, the US had 610,989 new cases on January 6th.....1404 deaths adding to our total of 832,392 deaths."
7052,"DW doesn&#39;t mentioned that France doubles &amp; UK quadruple Germany when it comes to testing for Covid, despite Germany having a much bigger population."
7053,"Put your hands together, raise them to the skies and ask for the reinfections not to start anywhere soon because one thing we already seen in this pandemic is that no politician is accountable"
7054,"The strain on public services isn&#39;t because of Omicron, it&#39;s because of politics and policy. Those workers aren&#39;t dead in the ground, or sick in a bed—they&#39;re home."
7055,"The initiatives as taken by policy-makers in most of the countries since the beginning of pandemic are cosmetic including vaccination drive. Unfortunately, It is evident now whether powerplayers admit this or not. Even more surprising is the fact that till date they kept on moving along the same route instead of exploring the root of crises. Take it granted, this pandemic related crises will take multidimensional exposure in near future globally if leaders do not rectify their approach."
7056,Yeh sure looks like it was a good idea ditching the emergency hospitals
7057,Fine job presentation
7058,Oh my 💔
7059,"I don&#39;t believe in government. We want to hear from nurses, doctors  and more that are in hospitals."
7060,"“Off sick or in self isolation”<br><br>How many are actually sick? Of them, how many are unvaccinated and never previously exposed?"
7061,"Honestly, I don&#39;t want to get vaccinated COVID-19 because of I feel sick. But I must do it to get third one for my family. Good luck to all of  us."
7062,"My cheeseburger restaurant is closed, and have had to make my own every single day for the past week"
7063,"We are winning 🏆 we habe the best politics, we have the best measurements, we have the best system like the UAS."
7064,French were mocking Romania in september 2021 that covid situation is out if control now the tables have turned
7065,The world is a scary place now
7066,can vaccinated people be also infected ?

Keep in mind it doesn&#39;t stop because Winter is over, this stuff infects all year long.
