Am RN who got lower resp infection in very early 2016 took mos to clear but got every symptom of MG and quit being able to only sleep. Have had wild covid in 2020 in March and all symptoms so bad was 8 mos of hourly struggles but because of hypoxia already had O2 and bipap at home. Have had 2 abn muscle biopsies, 3 abn  EMG and  had diagnosis pingpong played around me. In disgust I asked to try Mestinon even without antibodies. Had positive response in 2 days but not more than 30% improvement over a yr. Some days are nearly impossible to live through. Just glad to know am not alone, even as alone.",ashley right medical galighting us also think post covid stuff may happening earlier rn got lower resp infection early took mo clear got every symptom mg quit able sleep wild covid march symptom bad mo hourly struggle hypoxia already bipap home abn muscle biopsy abn emg diagnosis pingpong played around disgust asked try mestinon even without antibody positive response day not improvement yr day nearly impossible live glad know not alone even alone,0

760,"I appreciate the real statements of the nurses they included at the beginning of the video. Those are the hardships that healthcare workers face throughout the world. The physician that spoke about what could be done to lessen the workload and create a higher incentive to become a nurse were spot on. I work at a hospital in the ER, so I feel that I can say what I have to say about my hospital, but cannot speak for others. The first thing I have to say is the workload. Over the past few months, we have seen an explosion of patients. There is a combination of people who have COVID, people who are very sick because they did not want to leave their house to avoid COVID which made them more sick than ever, and people who think COVID has passed and decide to come into the ER for acute things. This caused an overflow of patients into our hospital which we have never seen before. We had gone from freaking out over 3-5 patients in the waiting room with 1 hour wait times to it being a regular day with 25+ patients waiting for 4 or more hours. We are not used to the amount of people that come in, so we become overworked. Another reason why we are overworked is because people leave to become travel nurses. The amount of work you do at our hospital is most likely going to be the same at the next hospital down the street. So why do people become travel nurses? A huge increase in pay. A person would go from making roughly $32 an hour to $100 an hour. They do not have to stress about the travel part too because just about every hospital in our area are in need of nurses. If people don't apply, you hire an agency. That's where travel nurses come in. That comes to my last point - pay. There is really no point in staying as a full time employee when you could be making 2 to 3 times the pay as a travel nurse. Yes it will not be forever, but it will be for a while. So why not take advantage of it? All your other coworkers are doing it. So now the ER is unrecognizable from how many veteran nurses that reached their pay cap left to be filled by a new nurse making twice as much as you. That's the reality our team faces in the ER. A solution for employee retention is very simple yet so hard because the CEO's need to stay rich and powerful and have influence over you. That solution is a higher pay rate. Even going an extra $3 an hour for your base pay rate could go distances. Unfortunately the reality is either no one has thought of that yet, or someone high up is rejecting that solution. Whatever the bureaucracy is going on up top, more nurses leave just to be filled by unfamiliar faces.",appreciate real statement nurse included beginning video hardship healthcare worker face throughout world physician spoke could done lessen workload create higher incentive become nurse spot work hospital er feel say say hospital cannot speak others first thing say workload past month seen explosion patient combination people covid people sick not want leave house avoid covid made sick ever people think covid passed decide come er acute thing caused overflow patient hospital never seen gone freaking patient waiting room hour wait time regular day patient waiting hour not used amount people come become overworked another reason overworked people leave become travel nurse amount work hospital likely going next hospital street people become travel nurse huge increase pay person would go making roughly hour hour not stress travel part every hospital area need nurse people apply hire agency travel nurse come come last point pay really point staying full time employee could making time pay travel nurse yes not forever not take advantage coworkers er unrecognizable many veteran nurse reached pay cap left filled new nurse making twice much reality team face er solution employee retention simple yet hard ceo need stay rich powerful influence solution higher pay rate even going extra hour base pay rate could go distance unfortunately reality either one thought yet someone high rejecting solution whatever bureaucracy going top nurse leave filled unfamiliar face,0

Whereas, if it was a cure (which it isn't), you would still be able to become infected, but it would save your life once the cure is administered to you, since a cure is only administered after you're already affected by something. There's a very big difference between a vaccine and a cure. One is preventative (vaccine) and the latter is reactive (to reverse the affects and save you). Please don't confuse the two.

This study also focuses on the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant by a combination of stenoparib and remdesivir.<br>The researchers of the current study also evaluated the inhibitory action of a combination of stenoparib and remdesivir against the Alpha variant. Vero E6 cells were infected with the Alpha variant, which was followed by an assessment of the activity of stenoparib using the plaque reduction assay. Plaques are areas of dead or destroyed cells that appear as small, clear regions in an infected cell monolayer after staining.<br>For the analysis, lower doses of stenoparib were combined with the previously reported 50% effective concentration (EC50) of remdesivir. Neither stenoparib nor remdesivir achieved greater than a 50% reduction in plaquing efficiency compared to the infected, untreated cells.<br>When combined, the drugs acted synergistically and plaque inhibition increased to over 90%. This activity was superior to what was achieved with either drug alone. Notably, this combination did not cause significant cytotoxicity.<br>Since both remdesivir and stenoparib have two different mechanisms of action, the combined effect of these drugs appears to be synergistic. This provides the potential benefit of minimizing undesirable side effects by reducing individual doses of each drug.<br>Stenoparib effectively inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type and variant strains in vitro.

3968,"The explanation of what is happening and why:<br>Under capitalism, all crises are crises of overproduction (for details, see the third volume of Marx's ""Capital"" or the chapter ""Economic Crises"" from the textbook ""Political Economy"" (1954, K. Ostrovitianov). Solvent demand lags behind the rate of production, the market becomes saturated, many commodities are unsold. This collapses the prices of these goods and, consequently, the profits of the owners of production. <br>To save their profits, under the guise of a ""pandemic"", global financial capital pursues the following goals:<br>1. Reducing/compressing production by shutting down production sites, moving enterprises to a part-time working week, ""quarantining"" workers without pay etc. (this is done to allow old goods to gradually dissipate and suspend the production of new ones). <br>2. Physical destruction of ""surplus"" products that cannot be sold (think of the destruction of millions of livestock, millions of tons of milk, vegetables, fruit, Dutch mink, etc., in 2020, under the pretext of the ""pandemic""). ""Swine flu"", ""bird flu"" and the ""African fever of swine"" are used for the same purpose - getting rid of ""surplus"" products in the food industry (also bankrupting the smaller producer).<br>3. Forcibly inflating commodity prices to compensate for the losses and to stop them falling as a result of overproduction, creating scarcity and hype<br>4. Hiding the fact that supply chain disruptions are the result of factory shutdowns (see 1) and other anti-crisis measures of capitalists<br>5. Labor force reductions. In order to hide the very fact that there is a colossal crisis requiring an unprecedented number of layoffs, in order to make money on ""vaccines"" and save on layoff payments, capitalists force hired workers to get ""vaccinates"" or to resign voluntarily by giving them the ultimatum of not being allowed to work without being ""vaccinated""<br>6. The elimination of small and medium-sized enterprises (i.e. smaller capitalists), to occupy their niche in the market<br>7. Reducing state budget expenditures (which under capitalism are at the disposal of the largest monopolies) on the social sector (primarily education and medicine).<br>8. Fighting against the growing protest wave and revolutionary upsurge caused by the crisis and measures undertaken to combat the crisis; this fight is carried out by demoralizing the population, banning gatherings, putting muzzles on people's faces, making it difficult to communicate, etc.<br>9. The intensification of economic exploitation (cancellation of benefits, bonuses, non-payment of salaries, prolonged working hours, reduction of benefits)<br>10. Inventing new sources of profit and forcing products on millions of people that they don't need (e. g., ""hygiene masks"", ""vaccines"", PCR ""tests"", medicines for ""covid treatment"" and various other ""covid"" equipment). By means of government contracts at the expense of the budget, billions of dollars in extra profits are pumped into the pockets of the largest capitalists.<br>Note, that the ""climate crisis"" is another disguise of all of the above-mentioned economic measures.",explanation happening br capitalism crisis crisis overproduction detail see third volume marx quot capital quot chapter quot economic crisis quot textbook quot political economy quot k ostrovitianov solvent demand lag behind rate production market becomes saturated many commodity unsold collapse price good consequently profit owner production br save profit guise quot pandemic quot global financial capital pursues following goal br reducing compressing production shutting production site moving enterprise part time working week quot quarantining quot worker without pay etc done allow old good gradually dissipate suspend production new one br physical destruction quot surplus quot product cannot sold think destruction million livestock million ton milk vegetable fruit dutch mink etc pretext quot pandemic quot quot swine flu quot quot bird flu quot quot african fever swine quot used purpose getting rid quot surplus quot product food industry also bankrupting smaller producer br forcibly inflating commodity price compensate loss stop falling result overproduction creating scarcity hype br hiding fact supply chain disruption result factory shutdown see anti crisis measure capitalist br labor force reduction order hide fact colossal crisis requiring unprecedented number layoff order make money quot vaccine quot save layoff payment capitalist force hired worker get quot vaccinates quot resign voluntarily giving ultimatum not allowed work without quot vaccinated quot br elimination small medium sized enterprise e smaller capitalist occupy niche market br reducing state budget expenditure capitalism disposal largest monopoly social sector primarily education medicine br fighting growing protest wave revolutionary upsurge caused crisis measure undertaken combat crisis fight carried demoralizing population banning gathering putting muzzle people face making difficult communicate etc br intensification economic exploitation cancellation benefit bonus non payment salary prolonged working hour reduction benefit br inventing new source profit forcing product million people need e g quot hygiene mask quot quot vaccine quot pcr quot test quot medicine quot covid treatment quot various quot covid quot equipment mean government contract expense budget billion dollar extra profit pumped pocket largest capitalist br note quot climate crisis quot another disguise mentioned economic measure,0

From what I understand the immunity from jabs is robust to start but, fizzel quickly(3 months it begins to fade I think).

Even the concept of a two week quarantine only covers 95% of incubation periods and remember most cases have mild to no symptoms even back with the original strains and the quarantines do not consider cohort groups where the disease can pass from one individual to the next.  The UK study that stated there was no active virus after eight days in their sample grouo did not fit a probability curve to their data so there is no guarantee that the disease woukd akways be no longer infectious after eight days yet we have our ten day self isolation policies now reduced to five days on tge basis of the mean incubation time dropping from 5.6 days (circa Jan 2020 data) to two days with Omicron, again no probability curve fit to determine the 95% confidence level.  All of our policies are on old, inconsistent, incomplete and questionable data, it's hard to believe a policy of absolute isolation can actually work with such procedures.  Tests, even PCR tests are of at the moment and are subject to actually sampling enough of the virus to detect and of course there are only so many tests you can do per day.  Zero COVID is based upon being able to absolutely isolate entire districts and cities and that in itself can simply not be achieved.   A zero COVID policy can slow down the spread hopefully to the point where contact tracing and subsequent isolation of outbreaks are possible but so long as there is some part of the world without measures as harsh, it may not be possible to maintain zero COVID policies for long and it's questionable how complete contact tracing can be, did they even distribute enough modern smart phones to effectively use contact tracing apps?

6564,"Zero COVID policy works perfectly in China, we may be afraid of that millions of Chinese people are temporarily restricted to take COVID test or may experience quarantine somewhere in China sometime, however for majority of Chinese people, they are pretty safe and free. Let us analyze it from perspective of data and take US and China as comparison, including the factor of freedom and quarantine, the quarantine in China can be defined as ""temporarily loosing freedom of going out for 2~3 weeks, normally stay at home or hotel room but with full support from community"". In US, the average daily case is around 66207K/730 =90k, with all time freedom, and in China, the average daily case is only 104745/730=143, the average daily quarantined people is estimated to 300K, when it is calculated based on 1.4 billion Chinese people, firstly the average rate of daily case is 143/1400000000 = 0.0001%,  that can be ignored, and the average daily rate to be quarantined in China is estimated to be 300K/1400000K = 0.021%, compared with US's average rate of CORVID case 90k/330000k=0.027%, we can see that ""the probability to be quarantined in China"" is less than ""the probability to get CORVID in US"", which results from that China is taking Zero COVID policy while US is not. Basically speaking, Zero COVID policy is successful, it changed a lot of persons from ""getting COVID"" status to just ""being quarantined"" status in terms of real result, which can also be proved by some international travelers once lived in US and now living in China.  (Note: Here I assume average daily people being quarantined is around 300K, this is rough estimation, during peak time it might be more than 10 millions, however there contains most time period close to only hundreds of persons being quarantined. I am just afraid that the average data of being quarantined might be overestimated).<br><br><br>Moreover, this special policy causes me to recall the Harvard lecture about ""Justice-what is the right thing to do""(Harvard lecture does not represent rightness, but really contains deep thinking that I would like to measure with). For reality in China, there exists the situation that some one need to scarify 2~3 weeks period of freedom(Being quarantined but with full support from surrounding, not too bad) to prevent another one person from getting CORVID virus, if these two persons are designated by someone with personal judgement, that will be unfair or unjust, but when we look into the fact that who will be who is actually random, and it is based on probability, the process is public and clear, it does not violate human's equality, instead it well meets Chinese moral principles that a lot of lives are saved, thus, the Zero COVID policy is quite fair and just to every people living or staying in China, and the result of this policy to fight against virus and keep people healthy is quite good as well.",zero covid policy work perfectly china may afraid million chinese people temporarily restricted take covid test may experience quarantine somewhere china sometime however majority chinese people pretty safe free let us analyze perspective data take us china comparison including factor freedom quarantine quarantine china defined quot temporarily loosing freedom going week normally stay home hotel room full support community quot us average daily case around k k time freedom china average daily case average daily quarantined people estimated k calculated based billion chinese people firstly average rate daily case ignored average daily rate quarantined china estimated k k compared us average rate corvid case k k see quot probability quarantined china quot le quot probability get corvid us quot result china taking zero covid policy us not basically speaking zero covid policy successful changed lot person quot getting covid quot status quot quarantined quot status term real result also proved international traveler lived us living china note assume average daily people quarantined around k rough estimation peak time might million however contains time period close hundred person quarantined afraid average data quarantined might overestimated br br br moreover special policy cause recall harvard lecture quot justice right thing quot harvard lecture not represent rightness really contains deep thinking would like measure reality china exists situation one need scarify week period freedom quarantined full support surrounding not bad prevent another one person getting corvid virus two person designated someone personal judgement unfair unjust look fact actually random based probability process public clear not violate human equality instead well meet chinese moral principle lot life saved thus zero covid policy quite fair every people living staying china result policy fight virus keep people healthy quite good well,0
